      "we're going to work our way up step-by-step,  \n",
      "00:00:23: and we'll get a little bit more \n",
      "advanced. By the end of this video,  \n",
      "00:00:27: you'll be able to write your very \n",
      "own source code and then run it.\n",
      "00:00:31: Now, how exciting is that?\n",
      "00:00:33: We're going to start with, well, why should you \n",

      "00:00:38: There are so many different \n",
      "programming languages out there.  \n",
      "00:00:41: Why should we choose Python? Then we're going \n",
      "to start with how do you even get Python?\n",
      "00:00:46: Where do you write your code?\n",
      "00:00:48: Then we'll go through things \n",
      "like operators, variables,  \n",
      "00:00:52: we'll create a function, we'll even jump \n",
      "into things like creating an if statement,  \n",
      "00:00:56: creating loops, so your code will run or \n",
      "execute until a certain condition is met.\n",
      "00:01:02: We'll even leverage others’ code \n",
      "by importing libraries into Python.\n",
      "00:01:07: By the end of this, you'll have a very solid \n",
      "understanding of how to get started with  \n",
      "00:01:12: programming. Think of this as a 100-level course \n",
      "that'll give you all of the most essential tools.\n",

      "that interests you the most.\n",
      "00:01:31: To get started, you might be wondering, \n",
      "well, why should I even learn how to program?\n",
      "00:01:36: How is this going to benefit me?\n",
      "00:01:38: Well, anytime you go on your phone \n",
      "or anytime you go on your PC,  \n",
      "00:01:43: you're experiencing the output of \n",
      "something that someone has programmed.\n",
      "00:01:48: So, you're realizing the benefit.\n",
      "00:01:50: Think of it this way. To program allows you \n",
      "to take maybe an idea that's in your head,  \n",
      "00:01:56: you can turn it into a series of steps that \n",
      "the computer can understand and execute.\n",
      "00:02:01: How cool is that?\n",
      "00:02:03: So, for example, maybe you have \n",
      "a game that you want to create.\n",
      "00:02:06: Maybe you want to create an application at work \n",
      "to help simplify what you do on a daily basis.\n",
      "00:02:12: By programming, you can do all of those things.\n",
      "00:02:15: It's an incredibly powerful \n",
      "skill to learn how to use.\n",
      "00:02:24: OK, so you want to learn how \n",
      "to program, but why Python?\n",
      "00:02:29: There are so many different programming \n",
      "languages out there, you have C, C Sharp,  \n",
      "00:02:34: C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, \n",
      "and the list goes on and on.\n",
      "00:02:39: Well, recently on my YouTube channel, I asked \n",
      "all of you what programming language do you  \n",
      "00:02:45: most want to learn about? And overwhelmingly, \n",
      "far and away, Python was the clear winner.  \n",
      "00:02:51: It was something like 65% of you wanted \n",
      "Python. And it kind of makes sense. When you  \n",
      "00:02:57: look at the lists of the most popular programming \n",
      "languages, Python tends to be right near the top.\n",
      "00:03:03: It's been around for a while.\n",
      "00:03:05: It's also pretty easy to use and also understand.  \n",
      "00:03:08: When you code using Python, it tends to \n",
      "be a very concise programming language.\n",
      "00:03:14: It's also a good general \n",
      "purpose programming language,  \n",
      "00:03:17: and what I mean by that, is you can \n",
      "write all sorts of applications.\n",
      "00:03:20: Maybe you want to write a web \n",
      "app, an internal company tool,  \n",
      "00:03:23: a game, or maybe you just want to \n",
      "conduct some scientific analysis.\n",
      "00:03:27: You can do all of that with Python.\n",
      "00:03:30: And all the things that you \n",
      "learn today related to Python,  \n",
      "00:03:34: you can take these same concepts and you can \n",
      "apply it to other programming languages as well.\n",
      "00:03:40: And really, fundamentally, you just \n",
      "want to take some idea you have,  \n",
      "00:03:45: you want to turn it into a series of \n",
      "steps that the computer can execute.\n",
      "00:03:49: And in a sense, it's kind of like a \n",
      "different language or a spoken language.\n",
      "00:03:53: So, in English I say hello, \n",
      "in German I'll say hallo,  \n",
      "00:03:57: and in French, I'll try my best, I'll say bonjour.\n",
      "00:04:00: And all of those communicate the same idea. \n",
      "I'm just saying hello, but it's a slightly  \n",
      "00:04:06: different way of saying it or speaking it, and \n",
      "that's the same with a programming language.\n",
      "00:04:12: They have different syntaxes. \n",
      "They also have different rules,  \n",
      "00:04:16: but at the end of the day, you're simply trying \n",
      "to communicate something to the computer,  \n",
      "00:04:20: because you want the computer to do something \n",
      "for you. Now of course, each programming language  \n",
      "00:04:25: might have its strengths or weaknesses, but \n",
      "you're really accomplishing the same objective.\n",
      "00:04:30: All right, so why don't we jump on the \n",
      "PC and let's get started with Python.\n",
      "00:04:39: Here I am now on my PC and first off I want \n",
      "to check if I already have Python installed.\n",
      "00:04:46: To do that on Windows 10, simply go down to your  \n",
      "00:04:49: taskbar and within the search \n",
      "field type in command prompt.\n",
      "00:04:53: Once you type in command \n",
      "prompt, click on the best match.\n",
      "00:04:57: This opens up your command \n",
      "prompt, and to check for Python,  \n",
      "00:05:00: simply type in Python and then type in --version.\n",
      "00:05:05: If you have Python installed, it'll tell you the \n",

      "00:05:58: Go ahead and download whichever \n",

      "00:06:01: I'll click on download and here it's \n",
      "kicked off the download process.\n",

      "00:06:07: This opens up the install prompt \n",
      "and right up here I could install.\n",
      "00:06:11: However, before we do that,  \n",
      "00:06:13: there’s an option right here at the \n",

      "00:06:18: Let's check that box and \n",
      "then click on install now.\n",
      "00:06:21: This now runs through the installation \n",

      "00:06:28: Let's now go down below and just like we \n",

      "Here I see Python 3.9. Let's click on this.\n",
      "00:07:00: This opens up the Python terminal, and I'll \n",
      "zoom in just a little bit, so it's a little  \n",
      "00:07:05: bit easier to see, and we can type in code \n",
      "directly here and Python will interpret it.\n",
      "00:07:12: So, what's an example of that?\n",
      "00:07:14: So, what if we type in what is 1 + 2 and I'll \n",
      "put a question mark in and let's hit enter.\n",
      "00:07:22: And this doesn't work.\n",
      "00:07:23: I see something that says \n",
      "syntax error, invalid syntax.\n",
      "00:07:28: Now the syntax is the rules of a programming \n",
      "language and when I typed in what is 1 + 2?\n",
      "00:07:35: This doesn't align with what Python is expecting.\n",
      "00:07:39: I need to type in a valid expression that \n",
      "the Python programming language understands.\n",
      "00:07:44: So, instead of typing in what is \n",
      "1 + 2, well I could just type in 1  \n",
      "00:07:49: and I'll type in + 2, and then I'll \n",
      "hit enter and there gives me 3 back,  \n",
      "00:07:53: so this was a valid expression in \n",
      "the Python programming language.\n",
      "00:07:59: Now, what's neat is when I type something \n",
      "into Python, like 1 + 2, Python takes each  \n",
      "00:08:04: line of code that I enter. So the 1 + 2, \n",
      "it interprets it, and then it evaluates it.\n",
      "00:08:10: So, it gave me 3.\n",
      "00:08:12: There are other programming languages \n",
      "where you have to compile it first  \n",
      "00:08:15: and then you can execute it, but with Python \n",
      "it'll interpret it as you’re going to.\n",
      "00:08:20: Now, now that we've typed in just a very \n",
      "basic expression, and we've evaluated it,  \n",
      "00:08:25: why don't we try a built-in function \n",
      "called print. Here I could type in print,  \n",
      "00:08:29: I'm going to open the parentheses, insert double \n",
      "quotes, and then I'll type in Hello World,  \n",
      "00:08:35: and I'll close my quotes and close my parentheses.\n",
      "00:08:37: Now this is one of the go to examples anytime \n",
      "you're starting with a new programming language.\n",
      "00:08:42: It's just hello world. Just testing it out.\n",
      "00:08:45: I'll hit enter and here it says Hello World, so \n",
      "it's sending back exactly what we sent into this  \n",
      "00:08:51: function. Now as we go throughout this, our \n",
      "programs are going to get a little bit more  \n",
      "00:08:55: complex, but this is just showing you the basics \n",
      "of how you can already start executing some code.  \n",
      "00:09:01: To exit out of the Python terminal, \n",
      "we can click on the X symbol up here  \n",
      "00:09:05: or we can type in another function called exit.\n",
      "00:09:08: Open your parentheses, close your parentheses,  \n",
      "00:09:10: then hit enter and that'll \n",
      "close out the terminal window.\n",
      "00:09:13: Now we executed some of our first code directly \n",
      "in the Python terminal, but you can also use  \n",
      "00:09:19: a text editor to write code. On Windows, \n",
      "there's a text editor called Notepad.\n",
      "00:09:25: Once again, go down to your taskbar and \n",
      "in the search field type in Notepad.\n",
      "00:09:29: I'll click on this right here.\n",
      "00:09:32: This opens up Notepad, and I'll zoom in \n",
      "just a little bit more. Now you probably  \n",
      "00:09:36: never knew that you can \n",
      "write source code in Notepad.\n",
      "00:09:38: It's actually a pretty powerful app. So right \n",
      "here, just like we did in the previous example,  \n",
      "00:09:43: I'll type in print and then I'll open \n",
      "my parentheses, put in a quote, and then  \n",
      "00:09:47: I'll type in Hello World once again, and then \n",
      "I'll close my quotes and close my parentheses.\n",
      "00:09:52: So, here's my source code written in Notepad.\n",
      "00:09:55: Now of course I want to be able to run this, so \n",
      "I need to save it as an appropriate file type.\n",
      "00:10:01: I'll go up to the file menu, go down to save \n",
      "as, and this opens up the save as prompt.\n",
      "00:10:06: Now maybe I'll just call this file, let's call \n",
      "it Hello World, and if I just leave it as that,  \n",
      "00:10:12: it'll save it as a .txt or basically \n",
      "just a standard text document.\n",
      "00:10:17: Now I want this to be a Python file and it \n",
      "turns out that the extension for Python is .py,  \n",
      "00:10:23: just like the extension for text files .txt, \n",
      "Python is .py, so here I'll type in .py.\n",
      "00:10:30: Depending on the programming \n",
      "language that you're using,  \n",
      "00:10:32: different programming languages \n",
      "have different extensions.\n",
      "00:10:35: For example, JavaScript is .js and every \n",
      "language will have its own extension.\n",
      "00:10:40: Now that I've typed this in, I'll save \n",
      "it to my desktop and then click on save.\n",
      "00:10:45: And here now I see the file on \n",
      "my desktop called Hello World.\n",
      "00:10:49: You'll also notice that it has the Python \n",
      "logo on it. Because we installed Python,  \n",
      "00:10:54: it correctly identifies that this is a .py \n",
      "file and so it sees that this is a Python file.\n",
      "00:11:00: Now let's test this out to see if we \n",
      "can run this source code that we wrote.  \n",
      "00:11:04: Down below on the taskbar, \n",
      "let's type in command prompt,  \n",
      "00:11:08: just like we did earlier, and \n",
      "let's open up the command prompt.\n",
      "00:11:11: I've adjusted the command prompt \n",
      "so it's a little bit easier to see,  \n",
      "00:11:14: and now I want to run this file \n",
      "over here in command prompt.\n",
      "00:11:18: To do that, let me type in Python.\n",
      "00:11:20: So, this will let the computer know that \n",
      "this is a Python file that I want to run.\n",
      "00:11:24: I'll put in a space, and I'll take my Python file,  \n",
      "00:11:27: and then I'll simply drag and \n",
      "drop it over into command prompt.\n",
      "00:11:30: Now this is a really cool trick  \n",
      "00:11:32: where you can get the location of the file \n",
      "simply by dragging and dropping it in.\n",
      "00:11:36: So here basically I'm saying I \n",
      "want to execute this Python file.\n",
      "00:11:40: Next, I'll click on enter and here we see that \n",
      "it prints hello world into my command prompt.\n",
      "00:11:46: This is exactly what I wanted it \n",
      "to do, so Python went through,  \n",
      "00:11:50: and it interpreted the code in this file \n",
      "and then it printed it here on my screen.\n",
      "00:11:55: You now know some of the basics of \n",
      "both writing and running Python code.\n",
      "00:12:00: Congratulations, you just wrote your first \n",
      "bit of source code, and you also ran it.\n",
      "00:12:06: You're making some good progress.\n",
      "00:12:08: Now, so far, we've just been writing \n",
      "our code in a text editor like Notepad,  \n",
      "00:12:13: and then we've been running it, \n",
      "and that works perfectly fine,  \n",
      "00:12:17: but it's not the most efficient way to write \n",
      "code, and I just want to give a parallel example.\n",
      "00:12:23: Let's say that maybe you're \n",
      "writing a document for school.\n",
      "00:12:26: You could write your document in Notepad. \n",
      "Now of course it does have some downsides.\n",
      "00:12:31: You don't have a spell check.\n",
      "00:12:33: You don't have a grammar \n",
      "check. You can't do formatting.\n",
      "00:12:35: So, although you can do it, it's \n",
      "going to require a lot more work.\n",
      "00:12:39: And that same concept also applies to programming.\n",
      "00:12:43: Sure, you could write your code in Notepad, \n",
      "or we can get what's called an IDE,  \n",
      "00:12:48: and that stands for integrated \n",
      "development environment.\n",
      "00:12:51: It'll just make writing code a \n",
      "lot more efficient and also easy,  \n",
      "00:12:55: and in a few moments, we'll see why that is.\n",
      "00:12:59: You have all sorts of IDEs \n",
      "that you can choose from.  \n",
      "00:13:02: On Apple, you have Xcode. On Android, you have \n",
      "Android Studio. With Ruby, you have RubyMine,  \n",
      "00:13:08: and there's also another one called Visual \n",
      "Studio Code and that works very well with Python.\n",
      "00:13:13: It's a product made by Microsoft, so of \n",
      "course I like it. I used to work at Microsoft,  \n",
      "00:13:17: but the great thing too is Visual \n",
      "Studio Code is entirely free,  \n",
      "00:13:21: so let's go to Visual Studio \n",
      "Code and let's get this IDE.\n",

      "the website code.visualstudio.com  \n",

      "terminal on the bottom of the screen,  \n",
      "00:17:42: and here I can see that it executed or interpreted \n",
      "this file and here it prints out hello world.\n",
      "00:17:48: So, it gives me the output \n",
      "of this code right up here.\n",
      "00:17:52: Along with right clicking on the screen and \n",
      "running the Python file in the terminal there,  \n",
      "00:17:57: I can also go to the top right-hand \n",
      "corner and I can click on this play icon.\n",
      "00:18:01: This will also run the Python file in \n",
      "the terminal, so when I click on this,  \n",
      "00:18:05: here too, it ran this file and \n",
      "here too I see hello world.\n",
      "00:18:08: So, this is just another way, probably a little \n",
      "bit easier to see the output of your code.\n",
      "00:18:14: Now that we know some of the basics of how to \n",
      "start writing code and how to run that code,  \n",
      "00:18:19: I want to show you how we can start working \n",
      "with operators to work with numbers.\n",
      "00:18:24: And here I'm going to type directly into the \n",
      "terminal down below, so I'll go down here to  \n",
      "00:18:29: the terminal and just like we did earlier \n",
      "in the Python terminal, I can type in here.\n",
      "00:18:33: So here I'll type in 1 + 2  \n",
      "00:18:36: and I'll hit enter and here it interprets \n",
      "that code, and it evaluates it to 3.\n",
      "00:18:40: So just like we saw earlier. One of the \n",
      "things is you'll notice when I typed in 1 + 2,  \n",
      "00:18:45: I didn't include any spaces and spaces or \n",
      "whitespace don't impact the calculation at all,  \n",
      "00:18:51: so I could also type in 1, space, and I'll type \n",
      "in plus, and then another space, and hit 2,  \n",
      "00:18:56: and then hit enter and there too it also evaluates \n",
      "it to 3, so using white space can actually make  \n",
      "00:19:02: your code more readable, so you could type it \n",
      "in like this, or just include some white space.\n",
      "00:19:06: It won't affect what the outcome is. With \n",
      "Python, I can use all of the standard  \n",
      "00:19:12: operators. Right up above, I showed you how \n",
      "you can do addition, but here let's say 5 – 2,  \n",
      "00:19:18: I can also do subtraction, and here \n",
      "it evaluates that to 3 as well.\n",
      "00:19:22: I could do a multiplication, so let's say 4 * 4.\n",
      "00:19:25: Now with multiplication, I enter in an asterisk.\n",
      "00:19:28: That's the multiplication symbol.\n",
      "00:19:30: Here I'll hit enter and it evaluates that to 16. I \n",
      "could also do division. Here I'll take 10 / 5 and  \n",
      "00:19:36: here for division, division is the forward slash, \n",
      "and then I'll hit enter and that evaluates to 2.\n",
      "00:19:42: Now with Python, let's say that \n",
      "you start using multiple operators,  \n",
      "00:19:46: so maybe you're adding and \n",
      "then you're multiplying.\n",
      "00:19:48: Python follows the default order of operations,  \n",
      "00:19:51: so let's say I enter in 2 + 2 \n",
      "and then I want to multiply by 5.\n",
      "00:19:57: What do you think this will evaluate to?\n",
      "00:19:59: Is it 2 + 2 which is 4 and \n",
      "then times 5 which is 20?\n",
      "00:20:02: Or is it 2 * 5 which is 10, and \n",
      "then you add 2 to that which is 12.\n",
      "00:20:06: Well here if I hit enter, it evaluates to 12,  \n",
      "00:20:09: because it's following the default order of \n",
      "operations. Multiplication comes before addition.\n",
      "00:20:16: If you've ever heard PEMDAS or Please Excuse \n",
      "My Dear Aunt Sally before, that's how you  \n",
      "00:20:22: know what the order of operations is. First \n",
      "it'll evaluate whatever is in parentheses.\n",
      "00:20:27: Then it'll look at any exponents followed by \n",
      "multiplication and division in the order of left  \n",
      "00:20:33: to right, and then it'll look at addition and \n",
      "subtraction also in the order of left to right.\n",
      "00:20:38: Up above, I could also enter \n",
      "in my expression up here,  \n",
      "00:20:41: so here I'll get rid of hello world and \n",
      "here I'll say let's print out 2 + 2.\n",
      "00:20:46: Here I'll click on run and here \n",
      "you'll see that it executes this  \n",
      "00:20:49: code Thanks for the suggestion! I’ve added this \n",
      "to my list. Stay tuned. Cheers!and here this also  \n",
      "00:20:51: evaluates to 4. If I want to use an exponent, \n",
      "I'll come up here. Let's remove the plus symbol,  \n",
      "00:20:57: and here I'll enter 2 asterisks, so \n",
      "this will be 2 to the power of 2.\n",
      "00:21:03: And here if I click on the play button, \n",
      "here that evaluates to four 2 * 2 is 4.\n",
      "00:21:08: But let's say I want to do a 2 to the 3rd.\n",
      "00:21:10: Here I'll evaluate and it comes out to 8. \n",
      "I also have access to the floor operator,  \n",
      "00:21:16: so let's take an example here. Let's say I \n",
      "want to calculate 5 / 2, and here I'll play  \n",
      "00:21:23: and right down here I see that's \n",
      "2.5, so I have a remainder of .5.\n",
      "00:21:27: But let's say I don't want to \n",
      "know what the remainder is.\n",
      "00:21:29: I just want to know how many times \n",
      "it goes in without a remainder.\n",
      "00:21:32: This is also known as the floor.\n",
      "00:21:34: I could insert another forward slash and then I \n",
      "could run it and here it tells me that it’s 2.\n",
      "00:21:40: But let's say I just want to \n",
      "know what the remainder is,  \n",
      "00:21:43: I can use the modulus operator for that.\n",
      "00:21:46: I'll get rid of the forward slashes, and \n",
      "right here, I'll type in the percent symbol,  \n",
      "00:21:51: then I'll hit go and here it \n",
      "tells me that the remainder is 1.\n",
      "00:21:55: As I'm entering in numbers up above \n",
      "and as I'm working with numbers,  \n",
      "00:21:58: let's say that I enter a very large number. \n",
      "So, let's say I enter in maybe 1,000,000.\n",
      "00:22:03: Now I could go through here and I could \n",
      "enter a comma and then I'll type in the zeros  \n",
      "00:22:08: and if I hit go here, you'll notice that \n",
      "it doesn't print what I expect it to.\n",
      "00:22:13: That's because we don't want to use \n",
      "commas as we're entering numbers.\n",
      "00:22:16: Instead, when you enter a number,  \n",
      "00:22:18: just enter it in as is and then hit go, \n",
      "and here it prints exactly what we expect.\n",
      "00:22:23: So, you don't want to use commas \n",
      "when you're entering in numbers.\n",
      "00:22:26: Now that we've entered in some numbers, and \n",
      "we know a little bit about the basics of  \n",
      "00:22:30: how you can work with numbers and operators,  \n",
      "00:22:32: let's start working with some text \n",
      "or what's referred to as strings.\n",
      "00:22:37: Let's say that I want to print what's up. \n",
      "Now earlier, we printed out hello world  \n",
      "00:22:42: and it's the same concept here. I'll insert in \n",
      "double quotes and then I'll type in what's up.\n",
      "00:22:47: So, here's what's up and I'll click on this play  \n",
      "00:22:50: icon and down below you'll see \n",
      "that the output is what's up.\n",
      "00:22:53: Now I surrounded what's up with double \n",
      "quotes. Now instead of using double quotes,  \n",
      "00:22:58: I can also use single quotes up here.\n",
      "00:23:01: So, if I enter in single quotes and then hit play, \n",
      "here too, you'll see that I get the same output,  \n",
      "00:23:06: so I can choose whether I want to \n",
      "use double quotes or single quotes.\n",
      "00:23:10: So why would I want to use \n",
      "one versus the other? Well,  \n",
      "00:23:13: here, what's up should actually have a single \n",
      "quote, so I'll insert a single quote there.\n",
      "00:23:18: Now one of the problems is when I enter \n",
      "a single quote here, it thinks that this  \n",
      "00:23:22: is the end of the string, and so now if I try \n",
      "to run it, I get a syntax error down below.\n",
      "00:23:27: So instead, I can use double quotes here \n",
      "and I'll use double quotes at the end,  \n",
      "00:23:31: and I could use a single quote in the middle \n",
      "and then here I'll run it and it works properly.\n",
      "00:23:36: Now let's say you wanted to use \n",
      "double quotes within your text.\n",
      "00:23:39: Well, you could surround it with single quotes \n",
      "and that way the double quotes would show up.\n",
      "00:23:44: Now here too, just like we saw before, \n",
      "whitespace doesn't impact how the code runs,  \n",
      "00:23:49: so if I want to insert a space here and maybe \n",
      "insert a space there and another space here  \n",
      "00:23:53: and I run this code, here you'll see \n",
      "that I get the exact same output.\n",
      "00:23:58: So once again, by using white space,  \n",
      "00:24:00: that can help make your code more \n",
      "readable as you're going through.\n",
      "00:24:05: We now know some of the basics of \n",
      "working with numbers and also strings,  \n",
      "00:24:09: but what if you want to make sure you \n",
      "explain what's happening in your code?\n",
      "00:24:13: How do we do that?\n",
      "00:24:14: Well, we can use something called a comment, \n",
      "so let's say that I have this code here and I  \n",
      "00:24:18: want to explain to someone what this does. Here \n",
      "I’ll bring this code down to the second line and  \n",
      "00:24:24: I can insert a comment by entering in the hash \n",
      "symbol or the number sign or the pound symbol,  \n",
      "00:24:30: so I'll enter that and here I \n",
      "can say this prints some text.\n",
      "00:24:36: I've now typed in my comment \n",
      "and let's run this now  \n",
      "00:24:39: and here you'll see that this doesn't \n",
      "affect at all what appears down here.\n",
      "00:24:43: I simply get what's up.\n",
      "00:24:44: So just like we got before. Now I could also take \n",
      "a comment and I could put it on a line with code.\n",
      "00:24:49: So here I'll put it after my code,  \n",
      "00:24:51: I'll hit run, and here too you see \n",
      "that it just gives me what's up.\n",
      "00:24:55: Now one of the neat things is,  \n",
      "00:24:56: let's say I start writing a lot of code \n",
      "and it's starting to get fairly complex.\n",
      "00:25:01: I can comment out a line of code.\n",
      "00:25:03: I'll put the hash symbol in front of my \n",
      "code and here you see it turns green,  \n",
      "00:25:08: so this is the IDE’s way of \n",
      "telling me that this is a comment.\n",
      "00:25:11: And here now, if I hit run, you'll see that I \n",
      "get no output. That's because I commented out  \n",
      "00:25:16: this line of code, so here I could bring it \n",
      "back by removing it and now here if I run it  \n",
      "00:25:21: once again it shows me what’s up. So comments \n",
      "are pretty valuable as you're writing code.  \n",
      "00:25:26: Not only to let other people know what's happening \n",
      "in your code and what different blocks of code do,  \n",
      "00:25:31: but you can also use it when \n",
      "you're troubleshooting to  \n",
      "00:25:34: cancel out certain areas of your code \n",
      "until you're ready to test them again.\n",
      "00:25:38: Next, we're going to look at \n",
      "how you can use variables,  \n",
      "00:25:42: and the easiest way to explain a variable is to \n",
      "use this red bucket that I have here from my son.\n",
      "00:25:50: So, let's pretend that this red bucket here \n",
      "is a variable and we can name the variable.\n",
      "00:25:55: Why don't we just call it red \n",
      "bucket, just to keep things simple.\n",
      "00:25:59: Now I can assign a value to this \n",
      "variable, so let's take for instance.\n",
      "00:26:04: Let's say I want the red \n",
      "bucket to equal my name Kevin.\n",
      "00:26:07: So here I have my name.\n",
      "00:26:09: I can take this value and I \n",
      "can assign it to this variable.\n",
      "00:26:13: So now if you say well, what \n",
      "is the red bucket, well,  \n",
      "00:26:15: right here the red bucket is currently Kevin.\n",
      "00:26:18: So once again, I've assigned that value to it.\n",
      "00:26:20: And this is a string or basically \n",
      "my name is referred to as a string.\n",
      "00:26:25: It's just a set of characters.\n",
      "00:26:27: Now I could assign other types of data to \n",
      "this variable as well, so maybe I say, well,  \n",
      "00:26:31: actually I want the red bucket now to equal \n",
      "a number, so maybe I want it to equal #8.\n",
      "00:26:36: So, I'm going to say red bucket, you're now \n",
      "equal to 8, so I'm going to take my name.\n",
      "00:26:40: We're going to pull that out, and here I'll take \n",
      "the number 8 and we'll put it in the bucket.\n",
      "00:26:45: So now if you ask me, well what is the red bucket?\n",
      "00:26:47: Well, it's currently the number 8.\n",
      "00:26:49: That's a general concept of a variable.\n",
      "00:26:52: The variable can hold different values.\n",
      "00:26:54: Let's jump in now and see how we can \n",
      "use variables. To create variables,  \n",
      "00:26:58: there are some rules that we need to follow, \n",
      "or this is the syntax that Python looks for.\n",
      "00:27:04: A variable should only contain \n",
      "letters, numbers or underscores.\n",
      "00:27:08: And also, we just need to make sure \n",
      "that we don't start with a number.\n",
      "00:27:12: We can't use any spaces in a variable name.\n",
      "00:27:14: We also can't use any known keywords \n",
      "to Python like break or try.\n",
      "00:27:19: And ideally, we want to make sure that a \n",
      "variable name is short and descriptive.\n",
      "00:27:24: Those work best.\n",
      "00:27:26: So, for example, with the red bucket, \n",
      "we'll now simply call the red bucket,  \n",
      "00:27:29: so it's pretty short and also descriptive.\n",
      "00:27:31: Also, variable names are case sensitive, so if \n",
      "I wrote red bucket with a capital R and another  \n",
      "00:27:37: one with a lowercase r, Python would view those as \n",
      "separate variables, so case sensitivity matters.\n",
      "00:27:45: OK, so let's create our first variable \n",
      "and just continuing the example,  \n",
      "00:27:49: let's say I want the variable to be called \n",
      "red bucket, so I'll give it this name  \n",
      "00:27:54: and now I need to assign a value to this variable, \n",
      "just like I did with the bucket. I'll type in  \n",
      "00:28:00: red_bucket and I'll type in the equal sign and I'm \n",
      "going to assign it the value of Kevin, my name.\n",
      "00:28:07: And here I'm using just a single equals sign. So,  \n",
      "00:28:10: what this does is it will assign \n",
      "this value to this variable.\n",
      "00:28:15: So now here I could hit enter and let me \n",
      "run this and here nothing shows up yet  \n",
      "00:28:19: because I've assigned this value to this variable.\n",
      "00:28:22: The next thing we could do \n",
      "is actually print this out.\n",
      "00:28:25: So here let me say print and \n",
      "let's type in red bucket.\n",
      "00:28:28: What's nice is because I'm using \n",
      "an IDE, it recognizes that I  \n",
      "00:28:33: created a variable called red bucket \n",
      "and I can just click on it here.\n",
      "00:28:37: Now if I click on the play icon, \n",
      "here it'll print out Kevin,  \n",
      "00:28:41: so it's printing out the value \n",
      "that's assigned to the red bucket.\n",
      "00:28:45: Now let's take another example here, \n",
      "let's say I add another line and  \n",
      "00:28:49: let me copy this first line and \n",
      "I'll paste it into the second line.\n",
      "00:28:53: And here I want to assign 10 to the red bucket.\n",
      "00:28:56: So here I start out by assigning \n",
      "Kevin and then I assign 10.\n",
      "00:29:00: What do you think will print out?\n",
      "00:29:02: Let's click on the play icon \n",
      "and here it prints out 10.\n",
      "00:29:05: And the reason why is, well, first \n",
      "it assigns Kevin to Red bucket,  \n",
      "00:29:08: and so that's the current value. But then \n",
      "on the next line of code, it assigns a 10  \n",
      "00:29:13: to the red bucket. So, the 10 overwrites Kevin, \n",
      "and then when I print out the red bucket,  \n",
      "00:29:19: it's taking the last value that was assigned \n",
      "to it. So, the way to think of this back to  \n",

      "00:29:37: One thing that's really neat about Python \n",
      "is when you're defining your variables,  \n",
      "00:29:42: you don't have to assign your variable a type.\n",
      "00:29:45: So here for example, for the red \n",

      "00:29:48: and that's also known as a string.\n",
      "00:29:51: And next I assigned a number, which is an \n",

      "00:29:59: it'll automatically know what data type \n",

      "00:30:04: So down here in print, I can type in type  \n",

      "the variable, so I'll get rid of this.\n",
      "00:31:40: So right now, I'm going to ask for input and \n",

      "you want to put in the bucket?\n",
      "00:31:51: And so maybe I want to put a shovel in,  \n",

      "00:31:57: And here now it prints out shovel, because \n",
      "that's now the value of the red bucket variable.\n",

      "using conditional logic in our code.\n",
      "00:32:09: Basically, any expression that you enter \n",
      "in breaks down to either true or false,  \n",
      "00:32:14: so let's just take an example.\n",
      "00:32:15: I'll go down a few lines and let me enter in \n",

      "I ask this question is 5 equals to 4,  \n",
      "00:32:26: I entered in two equal \n",
      "signs and that's not a typo.\n",
      "00:32:30: Up above, I just entered in one equal sign.\n",
      "00:32:33: So why do I enter one here \n",
      "and down here I enter two?\n",
      "00:32:36: Well up above, I'm taking this value or this \n",
      "input and I'm assigning it to this variable.\n",
      "00:32:42: Here I want to run a test for equality.\n",
      "00:32:45: I basically want to check are these two equal,  \n",
      "00:32:48: and when you test or check for \n",
      "equality, you use two equal signs,  \n",
      "00:32:53: so here let me remove the code up on top and \n",
      "I'm simply going to print out is 5 equal to 4.\n",
      "00:32:58: Here when I run it, here \n",
      "we'll see that no, it's false.\n",
      "00:33:01: 5 does not equal 4.\n",
      "00:33:03: Now you might be saying, well \n",
      "of course 5 isn't equal to 4.\n",
      "00:33:06: It's not equal to, so over here I can also \n",
      "check are they not equal to one another.\n",
      "00:33:10: So here instead of the equal sign, \n",
      "I'll insert an exclamation mark.\n",
      "00:33:14: So here I have an exclamation \n",
      "mark followed by an equal sign.\n",
      "00:33:17: So, this is my way of asking the \n",
      "computer is 5 not equal to 4?\n",
      "00:33:21: And I think we all know that's true.\n",
      "00:33:22: So, when I run it, here I get true back.  \n",
      "00:33:25: Along with equal to and not equal to, there \n",
      "are many other operators that I can also use.\n",
      "00:33:30: I have less than, greater than, greater \n",
      "than or equal to, and less than or equal to.\n",
      "00:33:35: And here you can see the symbol that you \n",
      "can use for these different operations  \n",
      "00:33:40: and over on the right-hand side, you'll see a few \n",
      "examples of how you could use this, so I could  \n",
      "00:33:44: insert any one of these into that print statement \n",
      "and you'll get this corresponding result.\n",
      "00:33:49: We can now take these different \n",
      "operations and we can combine it with  \n",
      "00:33:53: variables that we just learned about \n",
      "and so let's type in an example here.\n",
      "00:33:58: So, I have a young son at home. His name \n",
      "is Thomas and he's just three years old,  \n",
      "00:34:02: so let me create a variable and I'll call it \n",
      "Thomas age and it's currently equal to three,  \n",
      "00:34:07: so I'm taking this value of three and \n",
      "I'm assigning it to this variable.\n",
      "00:34:12: Now let's say I want to check, well, \n",
      "is he old enough for kindergarten.\n",
      "00:34:16: So maybe I type in age at and \n",
      "I'll type in kindergarten.\n",
      "00:34:21: And maybe age at kindergarten \n",
      "is 5, so I'll enter in equals 5,  \n",
      "00:34:25: so I now have two different variables and I've \n",
      "assigned a value to each of those variables.\n",
      "00:34:30: Now down here I can check the equality of these,  \n",
      "00:34:33: so maybe I'll say print and let's check is Thomas \n",
      "age, is that equivalent to the age at kindergarten  \n",
      "00:34:42: and so then I'll hit run and here we'll see \n",
      "that's false because basically Thomas age is  \n",
      "00:34:47: coming back as three, age at kindergarten \n",
      "is 5, and those don't equal one another.\n",
      "00:34:52: So, we can do this same type of check \n",
      "except we could do it using variables.  \n",
      "00:34:57: Now with this expression here, I'm simply checking  \n",
      "00:35:00: is Thomas’ age equal to the age at \n",
      "kindergarten and it comes back as false.\n",
      "00:35:05: But what if I want to do something \n",
      "a little bit more complex?\n",
      "00:35:08: What if I want to check, well if Thomas is \n",
      "less than the age at kindergarten, well,  \n",
      "00:35:12: he should probably be in preschool or daycare. \n",
      "And if he is 5, he should be in kindergarten.\n",
      "00:35:16: But if he's older than five, he \n",
      "should be in some other class.\n",
      "00:35:19: And right now, this is just doing one \n",
      "check, it's just looking at one point,  \n",
      "00:35:23: is he at the age for kindergarten?\n",
      "00:35:25: The easiest way to think of this is like \n",
      "a flow chart, so here I have the current  \n",
      "00:35:29: age and depending on his age, any one of \n",
      "these different scenarios could be true.\n",
      "00:35:34: Now I won't be able to do that with \n",
      "the simple expression that we wrote.\n",
      "00:35:37: That's just checking one thing.\n",
      "00:35:39: If I want to check multiple different criteria, \n",
      "this is when I can use an if statement.\n",
      "00:35:45: So, let's jump back into Visual Studio \n",
      "Code and let's look at how we can use this.  \n",
      "00:35:49: Back in Visual Studio, I'm going to delete this \n",
      "last line and I'll keep these two variables.\n",
      "00:35:54: The one with Thomas' age and the \n",
      "other one with the age at kindergarten  \n",
      "00:35:58: and I'll enter down a few lines. Once \n",
      "again, the white space doesn't matter,  \n",
      "00:36:02: so don't worry, you could enter \n",
      "down a few lines and now we want to  \n",
      "00:36:05: enter in an if statement. An if statement is \n",
      "really easy to write, you simply type in if.\n",
      "00:36:12: And here now I can do my check.\n",
      "00:36:15: So first I want to know is Thomas’ \n",
      "age less than the age at kindergarten?\n",
      "00:36:19: So here I can type in my variable.\n",
      "00:36:21: Once again it gives me this helpful suggestion \n",
      "of using Thomas’ age and first I can check if  \n",
      "00:36:27: he's younger than the age at kindergarten, \n",
      "so let me enter in the age at kindergarten.\n",
      "00:36:31: So, this is going to be my first check.\n",
      "00:36:34: Once I finish entering in this \n",
      "statement, I need to enter in a colon.\n",
      "00:36:38: And when I hit enter, this \n",
      "drops me down to the next line.\n",
      "00:36:41: One thing you'll notice is it \n",
      "automatically indented the line.\n",
      "00:36:45: What will happen is it will check this and if it \n",
      "turns out that Thomas’ age is less than the age  \n",
      "00:36:51: at kindergarten. In this case, Thomas is 3, the \n",
      "age of kindergarten is 5, so this would be true.\n",
      "00:36:56: It's going to evaluate this code, \n",
      "so whatever code I enter in here,  \n",
      "00:37:01: it'll go through and it'll execute that.\n",
      "00:37:04: So, let's test this out and let me type \n",
      "in print, so I'll enter in this function  \n",
      "00:37:08: and maybe we say something like \n",
      "Thomas should be in preschool.\n",
      "00:37:12: Once I finish typing that in, I'll go to \n",
      "the end of this line and hit enter again.\n",
      "00:37:17: Here you see that it continues to indent it.\n",
      "00:37:20: So basically, I can type in additional code \n",
      "and whatever I type in in this indented space,  \n",
      "00:37:26: it'll go through and it'll \n",
      "execute all of this code.\n",
      "00:37:30: Now I don't have anything else I want to run.\n",
      "00:37:32: I simply want to print out this message.\n",
      "00:37:34: Let's now test this out to see how it works.\n",
      "00:37:36: I'll go up here and click on run and here we get \n",
      "the text that says Thomas should be in preschool.\n",
      "00:37:42: Now let's say that maybe Thomas is 10 now.\n",
      "00:37:44: So here Thomas’ age is 10 and that is \n",
      "not less than the age of kindergarten.\n",
      "00:37:48: So, when I run, here I get nothing back because \n",
      "it evaluates this, and it comes back as false,  \n",
      "00:37:55: so it doesn't execute this code.\n",
      "00:37:57: Now there's nothing else here, \n",
      "so it simply returns nothing.  \n",
      "00:38:01: Now let's say I want some fall back, so let's say \n",
      "if this is false, I want to say something else.  \n",
      "00:38:06: Down here I can use else, so it'll check \n",
      "this, and it'll check if this is true,  \n",
      "00:38:11: but if it turns out being false, \n",
      "then it'll fall back to else.\n",
      "00:38:16: So here I'll enter an else, a colon, \n",
      "and here again it indents out.\n",
      "00:38:20: So here I could say, well if this isn't \n",
      "true then execute this block of code.\n",
      "00:38:25: So here maybe I'll insert another print function.\n",
      "00:38:28: So let me type in print.\n",
      "00:38:29: I'll open up the parentheses and let me type in \n",
      "Thomas should be in kindergarten or another class.\n",
      "00:38:36: So, I've now typed in my else statement, so \n",
      "let's try running it to see what it will happen.\n",
      "00:38:40: So, it'll check the first if statement,  \n",
      "00:38:42: that'll evaluates a false, and \n",
      "then it should fall back to else.\n",
      "00:38:46: Let's test this out. So when I hit \n",
      "run, here it says Thomas should be  \n",
      "00:38:50: in kindergarten or another class, so this \n",
      "logic is working exactly as we expect it to.\n",
      "00:38:56: Right now, I have two conditions here.\n",
      "00:38:58: I basically checked the first condition and if \n",
      "this is false, it just falls back to this one.\n",
      "00:39:03: But let's say I want to check \n",
      "for additional conditions.\n",
      "00:39:07: Here I'll enter down and let me get out of this \n",
      "block of code, so I'll hit the backspace key,  \n",
      "00:39:12: and right here, I can enter something \n",
      "called elif, basically else if,  \n",
      "00:39:16: so, you can go through and \n",
      "check any number of conditions.\n",
      "00:39:19: It'll start at the top and \n",
      "when it finds one that's true,  \n",
      "00:39:21: it'll display that message and then exit.\n",
      "00:39:24: But if this is false, it'll go to the \n",
      "next one and check that condition,  \n",
      "00:39:27: and I can add any number of else ifs in here.\n",
      "00:39:31: So I'll type in elif and maybe for this \n",
      "condition I want to know if Thomas is 5,  \n",
      "00:39:36: well he should be in kindergarten.\n",
      "00:39:38: So here I'll say Thomas age and here once again,  \n",
      "00:39:41: I want to check if it's equal \n",
      "to the age at kindergarten.\n",
      "00:39:44: And remember, we don't enter in one equal sign,  \n",
      "00:39:46: we enter in two and here I'll enter in \n",
      "the other variable age at kindergarten.\n",
      "00:39:50: So, this is going to be my check.\n",
      "00:39:52: And if this is true, we now want to evaluate \n",
      "some code. Now just like we did before where  \n",
      "00:39:56: I entered the colon, let's make sure \n",
      "we enter in a colon here at the end.\n",
      "00:40:00: That's part of Python syntax.\n",
      "00:40:02: I'll hit enter and this automatically indents me.  \n",
      "00:40:05: Here I'll type in print, and I'll type in \n",
      "some text that says enjoy kindergarten.\n",
      "00:40:10: Now I've added this else if statement that \n",
      "checks to see if he's in kindergarten.\n",
      "00:40:14: So, this last statement no longer makes sense \n",
      "where I say Thomas should be in kindergarten or  \n",
      "00:40:19: another class, so maybe I simply remove this \n",
      "and I say Thomas should be in another class,  \n",
      "00:40:26: so this will just be my catch all at the end.\n",
      "00:40:28: So, let's test this out to see how it works.\n",
      "00:40:30: So, let's say Thomas is 3 and I run it.\n",
      "00:40:33: In this case, the first condition here is true.\n",
      "00:40:36: So, Thomas should be in preschool \n",
      "and here I get the text down below.\n",
      "00:40:39: Thomas should be in preschool.  \n",
      "00:40:41: Now let's say Thomas is equal to five, \n",
      "or maybe he's five years old now.\n",
      "00:40:44: When we run it, here the first condition \n",
      "is false, so it skips over that one.\n",
      "00:40:48: It looks at the second condition,  \n",
      "00:40:50: this elif, and here Thomas is 5 \n",
      "and that's the age at kindergarten.\n",
      "00:40:54: So here I get the text saying enjoy kindergarten.\n",
      "00:40:57: And let's say now that maybe Thomas is 10.\n",
      "00:41:00: So here when I run it, it evaluates \n",
      "the first statement and, well,  \n",
      "00:41:03: he's older than the age of \n",
      "kindergarten, so that's false.\n",
      "00:41:05: His age is not equal to the age of \n",
      "kindergarten, so that's also false,  \n",
      "00:41:09: and then it falls back to the else statement, \n",
      "and so Thomas should be in another class.\n",
      "00:41:13: So here we've just tested that this \n",
      "is working just like we expect it to.\n",
      "00:41:17: Next, I want to show you how we can use \n",
      "functions in Python and if you've ever  \n",
      "00:41:23: used any other programming language before, you \n",
      "might know them as a subroutine or a method,  \n",
      "00:41:28: but it's all the same thing, so \n",
      "we're going to use functions.\n",
      "00:41:31: And you've actually already been using a function.\n",
      "00:41:34: We used the print function. Right here you see \n",
      "that we've been using print multiple times.\n",
      "00:41:39: This is a function. You call this \n",
      "function, you pass in some text,  \n",
      "00:41:43: and then it prints it out on the screen.\n",
      "00:41:45: So that's just a basic example of a \n",
      "function that we've already been using.\n",
      "00:41:49: Now the cool thing is we \n",
      "can create our own function.\n",
      "00:41:53: So, what is a function?\n",
      "00:41:55: Well, it's basically a block of code  \n",
      "00:41:58: that you can package together \n",
      "with a name and it does something.\n",
      "00:42:01: So, in this case anytime you call print \n",
      "or input, it takes some action depending  \n",
      "00:42:07: on what that function is. The neat thing is it \n",
      "makes your code more modular and also reusable.\n",
      "00:42:13: So here for example, every time we \n",
      "want to print something on the screen,  \n",
      "00:42:16: we simply call this function \n",
      "and then it takes that action.\n",
      "00:42:19: We don't have to enter in all the different code \n",
      "associated with printing your text on the screen.\n",
      "00:42:24: We simply rely on this function.\n",
      "00:42:26: So, it makes your code a lot more reuseable.\n",
      "00:42:29: So let's go through and create our own function.\n",
      "00:42:32: Right now, I'll go through and delete all of this \n",
      "code that we had and let's say just to show the  \n",
      "00:42:37: value of functions, let me just enter in print \n",
      "and then Kevin Stratvert has a great channel.\n",
      "00:42:42: I'm going to enter this in three times.\n",
      "00:42:44: I figure the more I say it \n",
      "maybe the more it sticks,  \n",
      "00:42:47: then the more you read it, \n",
      "you might start to believe it.\n",
      "00:42:50: So here I've typed it in three different \n",
      "times and now I'm going to run it.  \n",
      "00:42:55: Here I'll expand the terminal just so we \n",
      "could see it and here printed out three times.\n",
      "00:43:00: Oh, but actually, look at that.\n",
      "00:43:02: It looks like I spelled Stratvert \n",
      "wrong. Stratvert has a T in the middle,  \n",
      "00:43:06: and here I just say Stravord. Now because \n",
      "I'm not using a function for this, well,  \n",
      "00:43:11: I'm using the print function, but I haven't \n",
      "created a function to print this out three times,  \n",
      "00:43:15: so I'd have to go through, and I'd have to \n",
      "correct every single Stravert throughout my code  \n",
      "00:43:20: to correct this and imagine that \n",
      "you referenced something many,  \n",
      "00:43:24: many, many times in your code, and maybe you \n",
      "make an error, you need to update something.\n",
      "00:43:28: It could be a pain to have to go \n",
      "through all of your code to update it.\n",
      "00:43:32: So instead, you can create a function, and \n",
      "I'll show you how we can create a function  \n",
      "00:43:36: to print this out multiple times, and \n",
      "then we can call it whenever we want.\n",
      "00:43:41: OK, so let's create a function.\n",
      "00:43:42: I'll simply go down a few lines.\n",
      "00:43:45: To create a function, we have to type in def.\n",
      "00:43:47: This basically stands for define, so I'll \n",
      "type in def and here we can type in a name  \n",
      "00:43:54: for our function, and I'm going to call \n",
      "this function, let's say print Kevin.\n",
      "00:44:00: So, I've typed in my function name and then all \n",
      "functions need to have parentheses at the end, so  \n",
      "00:44:04: I'll open the parentheses, close the parentheses, \n",
      "and write down here, once again, just like we did  \n",
      "00:44:09: with the if statement, I'll insert a colon. So, \n",
      "I now have my function. When I hit the enter key,  \n",
      "00:44:15: here too, just like with the if statement, \n",
      "you see that it indents it automatically.\n",
      "00:44:19: So once again, it indents and any of the code \n",
      "underneath here will be part of this function.\n",
      "00:44:25: Next, I want to enter in some code in \n",
      "this function, so maybe I'll set up  \n",
      "00:44:28: a variable and I'll call this text and \n",
      "let me insert some text here in quotes,  \n",
      "00:44:33: and maybe I'll say Kevin Stratvert has a \n",
      "great channel, so that's going to be my text.\n",
      "00:44:39: And here maybe I'll just make the \n",
      "error again where I don't have the T.\n",
      "00:44:43: Now right beneath that, here I could use \n",
      "print and maybe I say let's print the text  \n",
      "00:44:47: and I want to print this three times.\n",
      "00:44:50: So, I'll insert it in three times right here.\n",
      "00:44:52: I'm going to delete this earlier example \n",
      "here so we just have the function.\n",
      "00:44:57: So, I have my function now, can I run it?\n",
      "00:44:59: Let's try clicking on run. So I \n",
      "click on run, and I get nothing back.\n",
      "00:45:04: And the reason why is right up \n",
      "here, we've defined a function,  \n",
      "00:45:08: but we haven't actually called this function.\n",
      "00:45:11: So, I've defined what should happen when \n",
      "I call this, but we haven't called it yet,  \n",
      "00:45:15: so here I'll go down and I'll backspace, \n",
      "so I'm out of this block of code that's  \n",
      "00:45:20: associated with this function, and \n",
      "here now I can call my function.\n",
      "00:45:23: So just like we called the print \n",
      "function, here I could say print  \n",
      "00:45:27: and let's type in underscore Kevin and \n",
      "then I'll open and close my parentheses.\n",
      "00:45:31: So right now, this will call the function. \n",
      "So, when Python sees print Kevin,  \n",
      "00:45:37: it'll look up to this definition for \n",
      "Kevin and then it'll execute this code.\n",
      "00:45:41: So, let's click on run to see what happens.\n",
      "00:45:44: Now look at that. Kevin Stravert has a great \n",
      "channel and it printed it out three times.\n",
      "00:45:48: Oh, and look, there's that error in here.\n",
      "00:45:51: So right up here, I could go to my function.\n",
      "00:45:53: I could add the T and then \n",
      "I can hit run and it looks  \n",
      "00:45:56: like that's now successfully updated in all cases.\n",
      "00:45:59: Now I could go through, and I could \n",
      "call this function multiple times.\n",
      "00:46:02: This will really boost my ego.\n",
      "00:46:05: So now when I hit run, look how many times \n",
      "it's printed out, Kevin has a great channel,  \n",
      "00:46:09: every single time I reference this \n",
      "function, it'll go back up here,  \n",
      "00:46:12: it'll look at the function definition, and \n",
      "then it'll run this code within that function.  \n",
      "00:46:17: Wth a function, to be able to call the function, \n",
      "I first need to define it before I can call it.\n",
      "00:46:23: Here I'll remove these two \n",
      "references to the function  \n",
      "00:46:26: and so let's take the call of the \n",
      "function and I'll move it to the very top.\n",
      "00:46:30: So here I call the function and then I define it.\n",
      "00:46:32: So, if I hit run now here you get an error \n",
      "because here it says we'll print Kevin.\n",
      "00:46:36: Well, it doesn't know about that function \n",
      "yet because it comes up later on in the code.\n",
      "00:46:41: So once again, I need to make sure I call \n",
      "this function after I've defined my function.\n",
      "00:46:45: So typically in code, you'll see all \n",
      "the different definitions or all of the  \n",
      "00:46:49: different definitions of the functions at the top.\n",
      "00:46:52: One of the neat things too about \n",
      "using Visual Studio Code is here  \n",
      "00:46:56: when I click over in the function and I \n",
      "hover over, I can collapse this function.\n",
      "00:47:00: So let's say I'm writing code and I want to have a \n",
      "whole bunch of functions that do different things.\n",
      "00:47:05: I can collapse it and then that way it \n",
      "clears up my view a little bit and here  \n",
      "00:47:09: I could expand it if I need to jump into this \n",
      "function and update any of the code within.  \n",
      "00:47:14: With this one function that I defined on \n",
      "top, currently I don't pass anything into  \n",
      "00:47:19: the function and I also don't get \n",
      "anything back from the function.\n",
      "00:47:23: If you remember the print \n",
      "example, here with print,  \n",
      "00:47:26: I'm passing in certain text that I want to print.\n",
      "00:47:28: So basically, I'm sending in \n",
      "an argument or a parameter,  \n",
      "00:47:31: and I can do the same when I create a function.\n",
      "00:47:34: So, let's say instead of entering the text here \n",
      "within the function, let me actually get rid of  \n",
      "00:47:39: this line right here, and right up here as part \n",
      "of my function definition, I'll type in text.\n",
      "00:47:45: So, as I define my function, it's \n",
      "expecting me to pass in some value.\n",
      "00:47:50: So, let's now go down here and look at the \n",
      "position where I'm calling my function.\n",
      "00:47:55: It says print Kevin and here I can now pass \n",
      "in a value or basically pass in a parameter.\n",
      "00:48:01: So, I'll type in Kevin \n",
      "Stratvert has a great channel.\n",
      "00:48:06: So here you'll see as I call this function, \n",
      "it's passing in this parameter or this argument.\n",
      "00:48:12: When I pass this in, here in the definition, it \n",
      "says it's expecting some text to be passed in  \n",
      "00:48:18: and down below the print is taking that \n",
      "text that I pass into this function.\n",
      "00:48:23: So now when I hit run, here \n",
      "you'll see the same result.\n",
      "00:48:25: Kevin Stratvert has a great channel  \n",
      "00:48:27: and this is just an example of how you \n",
      "can pass values into your function.\n",
      "00:48:31: Next, I want to show you how we can \n",
      "put an if statement within a function.\n",
      "00:48:36: So here again I'll type in def.\n",
      "00:48:38: This will define my function and I'm \n",
      "going to call this school age calculator.\n",
      "00:48:43: So, I want to basically \n",
      "determine based on a child's age,  \n",
      "00:48:46: where should they be in school, and \n",
      "I want to get two different values.\n",
      "00:48:50: I want to get the child's age, \n",
      "so I'll type in age as one of the  \n",
      "00:48:54: parameters or arguments I want to get, \n",
      "and I also want the name of the child.\n",
      "00:48:58: Now, just like we did before, let's put in \n",
      "a colon here and then let's press enter.\n",
      "00:49:02: Here once again, you'll see that \n",
      "it automatically indents me and  \n",
      "00:49:05: so that shows that whatever code I \n",
      "write here is part of this function.\n",
      "00:49:10: Now I want to insert my if statement, so I'm going \n",
      "to check first off if the age is less than five.\n",
      "00:49:17: Once again, I'll insert the colon, and when I \n",
      "press enter, here it indents me even more so.\n",
      "00:49:21: Now I'm within this if statement,  \n",
      "00:49:23: so if this evaluates to true, \n",
      "we're going to execute this code.\n",
      "00:49:27: If it's true, I want to display some text, \n",
      "so here I'll call the print function.  \n",
      "00:49:31: Here I'll open it up and maybe \n",
      "I show some text that says  \n",
      "00:49:35: enjoy the time. You're still a young \n",
      "guy, you don't need to be in school yet.\n",
      "00:49:39: So I've typed in some text. Now earlier \n",
      "we've just been printing out text,  \n",
      "00:49:43: but I can also print out \n",
      "variables together with text.\n",
      "00:49:46: So here I could enter a comma \n",
      "and then I'll type in the name.\n",
      "00:49:50: Here I'll type in another comma and let \n",
      "me enter in quotes again, and I'll say  \n",
      "00:49:54: is only, here I'll enter another comma, \n",
      "and then I'll type in the variable age.\n",
      "00:49:58: So here you can see what it'll do, let's \n",
      "say the age is 3 and the name is Thomas.\n",
      "00:50:03: It'll say enjoy the time, Thomas is only three, \n",
      "so that's what will display if he's under 5.\n",
      "00:50:09: Let me hit enter and here now I \n",
      "want to enter another condition,  \n",
      "00:50:12: so I'll hit back space so I go back, and \n",
      "here I'll enter elif, basically else if  \n",
      "00:50:18: and I want to say if age let's \n",
      "say, is equivalent to five,  \n",
      "00:50:23: then I'll enter the colon and here maybe I'll say \n",
      "enjoy kindergarten, and then I'll show the name.\n",
      "00:50:28: So here I'll type in print and \n",
      "then I'll open the parentheses  \n",
      "00:50:32: and I'll type in the quotes and \n",
      "here we'll say enjoy kindergarten,  \n",
      "00:50:36: and here I'll type in a comma and let me type in \n",
      "another comma here and then I'll display the name.\n",
      "00:50:41: So here it'll say enjoy kindergarten, Thomas.\n",
      "00:50:44: And lastly, I want to add one more condition, \n",
      "so I'll hit enter, backspace, and here I can  \n",
      "00:50:49: say else, colon, and here, maybe I'll say print \n",
      "and this one, I'll just display text and I'll  \n",
      "00:50:55: say they grow up so fast exclamation mark. \n",
      "I've now finished defining my function and I  \n",
      "00:51:02: have all of the different conditions within \n",
      "the function, so here I could enter down,  \n",
      "00:51:06: and I'll press backspace twice, so I exit out \n",
      "of both the conditions and also the function.\n",
      "00:51:12: So now here I can call my function. So,  \n",
      "00:51:14: I'll call school age calculator and here \n",
      "I need to pass in two different values.\n",
      "00:51:20: I'll pass in the age, I'll enter a comma, \n",
      "and then I'll type in the name, Thomas.\n",
      "00:51:25: So now if I run this, here you'll see that it \n",
      "calls the function and then it goes through  \n",
      "00:51:29: all of these different conditions, and so here, \n",
      "while Thomas is less than five, he's only three,  \n",
      "00:51:34: so it says enjoy the time, Thomas is \n",
      "only three, and here we can test it out,  \n",
      "00:51:38: here I'll change it to five, and if I run \n",
      "it here, it says enjoy kindergarten, Thomas,  \n",
      "00:51:43: and let's say Thomas is now 10, and I'll run \n",
      "it, and here it says they grow up so fast.\n",
      "00:51:48: So here now you see how we can call a function \n",
      "and here we pass in values into that function,  \n",
      "00:51:54: and it uses those values to run an if \n",
      "statement and to evaluate which one is true.\n",
      "00:52:00: Next I want to show you how you can also \n",
      "get a parameter back from your function.\n",
      "00:52:05: So so far, we've looked at how you could just run \n",
      "a function on its own, how you could pass values  \n",
      "00:52:10: into the function, and now we're going to look at \n",
      "how you can get a value back from the function.\n",
      "00:52:15: I'm going to go through, let's remove this code \n",
      "right here, and let's start again from scratch.\n",
      "00:52:20: For this one, it's just going \n",
      "to be a really simple example.\n",
      "00:52:23: I want to know what is your age going to be in \n",
      "10 years and we'll use a function to do this.\n",
      "00:52:29: So here once again, let's define \n",
      "a function by typing in def  \n",
      "00:52:33: and here the function name will be add ten to age.\n",
      "00:52:36: Once I've typed in the function name,  \n",
      "00:52:38: here I want to get one bit of input \n",
      "into my function or one parameter.\n",
      "00:52:42: Here I'll type in the age, so \n",
      "someone will send in their age,  \n",
      "00:52:45: and then the function will add 10 to that age.\n",
      "00:52:48: At the end of the definition of the \n",
      "function, let's enter a colon and hit enter.\n",
      "00:52:52: Here this automatically indents me and now right \n",
      "now I want to figure out what the new age is.\n",
      "00:52:58: So here I'll create a variable called New Age  \n",
      "00:53:01: and I want to set that equal to \n",
      "the age that's being passed in.\n",
      "00:53:05: So, I'll type in age and I'm going to add \n",
      "10 to it, and right underneath that now  \n",
      "00:53:10: once the function runs through and it does \n",
      "its magic, I want to return that value,  \n",
      "00:53:15: so here I'll type in return, and I want to \n",
      "return the new age, so I'll select this.\n",
      "00:53:20: This will send the value back or return the \n",
      "value once the function is done running.  \n",
      "00:53:26: Here now, I want to call my function, \n",
      "and when I call the function,  \n",
      "00:53:29: I can assign that return value to a variable.\n",
      "00:53:32: So here maybe I create a new \n",
      "variable called How old will  \n",
      "00:53:36: I be and I can set that equal to my function.\n",
      "00:53:41: So here I'll call the function add ten to age  \n",
      "00:53:44: and here I want to pass in let's say my \n",
      "son who’s three, so I'll pass in three.\n",
      "00:53:50: So once again, if I run this right \n",
      "now, it won't actually do anything.\n",
      "00:53:53: It's assigning the output, which is 13 to how \n",
      "old will I be, but now I need to print it out.\n",
      "00:53:59: So right down here let me type in print and \n",
      "I'm going to print in how old will I be.\n",
      "00:54:05: And now if I hit run, here we'll \n",
      "see that that comes back as 13.\n",
      "00:54:10: Now once again, just to see how this \n",
      "works, here I'm saying how old will I be?\n",
      "00:54:14: This is a variable and I'm assigning this value \n",
      "to it, which is basically my function of add  \n",
      "00:54:19: ten to age, and I'm passing in three, so here \n",
      "it gets the age of three, it takes 3, adds 10,  \n",
      "00:54:26: it assigns its new age and once it's done running \n",
      "through the function, it returns the new age.\n",
      "00:54:31: So, the new age is 13 and it assigns 13 to how \n",
      "old will I be and then here it prints out 13.\n",
      "00:54:37: So that's how it works, and that's how you can \n",
      "get or you could return a value from a function.\n",
      "00:54:43: Next, we're going to look \n",
      "at how you can use loops.\n",
      "00:54:46: What is a loop?\n",
      "00:54:48: Basically, it allows you to execute a block of \n",
      "code multiple times, so think of it this way.\n",
      "00:54:55: Every single week my wife \n",
      "comes to me and says, Kevin,  \n",
      "00:54:58: can you take out the trash, and \n",
      "she asks me that every single week.\n",
      "00:55:03: So, in a sense, that's kind of like a loop.\n",
      "00:55:06: All right, let's jump on the PC and let's \n",
      "see how we can create a loop in Python.\n",
      "00:55:11: So, let's now create a loop and there \n",
      "are two different types of loops.\n",
      "00:55:15: One of them is called a while loop and \n",
      "the other one is called a for loop.\n",
      "00:55:20: We're going to start with a while loop, \n",
      "and it's actually pretty easy to do.\n",
      "00:55:25: I'm going to create a variable, just call \n",
      "it X and I'll assign it the value of 0.\n",
      "00:55:31: And so here now I can type in a while loop.\n",
      "00:55:33: So, I'll say, let's say while and \n",
      "let's say X is less than five.\n",
      "00:55:38: So, while this value is less than five, I want it \n",
      "to execute some code, so here I'll insert a colon.\n",
      "00:55:45: We do this with our if \n",
      "statements, with our functions.\n",
      "00:55:47: Here when I hit enter now, it automatically \n",
      "indents me, so I'm now within the loop.\n",
      "00:55:52: And here I could just say let's say print X, so \n",
      "I'll enter that in and then right after I print X,  \n",
      "00:55:58: I want to make sure I increment X, \n",
      "otherwise it will be an infinite loop.\n",
      "00:56:01: So here I'll type in X = X + 1, \n",
      "just a really simple example.\n",
      "00:56:06: We start out at zero and here it \n",
      "will say if X is less than five,  \n",
      "00:56:10: in which case it starts at zero. It is, so \n",
      "then it prints X, and then we add one. So  \n",
      "00:56:14: now X is 1 and X is still less than five, \n",
      "so it'll keep executing until it reaches 4.\n",
      "00:56:20: So, let's run this to see how it works. So \n",
      "here it prints out 01234 and then once X = 5,  \n",
      "00:56:27: well, it's no longer less than five, so \n",
      "then we exit our loop and it's all done.\n",
      "00:56:32: Note, that's the basics of how you \n",
      "can create just a very simple loop.\n",
      "00:56:36: There's also another loop called a for loop, so \n",
      "I'll go down right here and let's type in for.\n",
      "00:56:42: And this is also pretty simple. Here I can type \n",
      "in for and let's say 4 X in range, let's say five  \n",
      "00:56:50: through 10, and then here \n",
      "I'll close the parentheses,  \n",
      "00:56:53: enter a colon, and here too, \n",
      "I'll print the value of X.\n",
      "00:56:56: Let me delete the code up above, and here \n",
      "what it'll do is it'll go through that range,  \n",
      "00:57:02: so when I hit run here, you see that it starts \n",
      "at 5 and it goes all the way up until 10,  \n",
      "00:57:07: but it doesn't include 10, so this is \n",
      "another form of a loop that you can use.\n",
      "00:57:12: You can do some pretty neat things with loops. \n",
      "Here for example, I have the variable days and  \n",
      "00:57:18: I have an array assigned to it and \n",
      "these are just all the days of the week.  \n",
      "00:57:23: Here I can use a for loop to write out all the \n",
      "days of the week, so here I could say for d,  \n",
      "00:57:29: here I'm creating a variable, and I'll say in \n",
      "days, so here I'm looking at this variable.\n",
      "00:57:34: Here I'll insert a colon and maybe I just want to \n",
      "print out the value of d. So, as it goes through  \n",
      "00:57:40: each day of the week, and here I can enter run \n",
      "and here it'll go through the variable of days,  \n",
      "00:57:45: and here it prints out every single \n",
      "day of the week, so that's pretty cool.\n",
      "00:57:49: Now, one of the neat things too is you can start \n",
      "using some of the logic that we learned up above  \n",
      "00:57:54: in your loops, so let's say that I want \n",
      "to know what are all of the days before  \n",
      "00:57:59: Thursday, and once we hit \n",
      "Thursday, I want you to stop.  \n",
      "00:58:03: Here I can insert an if statement, so I'll say \n",
      "if and let's say if d is equivalent to let's say  \n",
      "00:58:10: Thursday, so I'll type in Thursday, and at this \n",
      "point I want it to stop. So I'll type in break.\n",
      "00:58:17: So here if we click on run, here you'll \n",
      "see it goes through Monday, Tuesday,  \n",
      "00:58:21: Wednesday and then it looks like it hits \n",
      "Thursday, and at that point we stop the loop.\n",
      "00:58:26: So, at that point we break,  \n",
      "00:58:28: and we no longer print any of the other days. \n",
      "With loops, we can also skip over items.\n",
      "00:58:34: So, let's say that once we get to Thursday, I \n",
      "don't want it to include Thursday in the list,  \n",
      "00:58:39: but I still want it to continue \n",
      "and look at Friday, Saturday,  \n",
      "00:58:42: and Sunday. Instead of using break, \n",
      "I can use something called continue.\n",
      "00:58:47: So now when I run the code, here \n",
      "you'll see Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,  \n",
      "00:58:50: and then it found Thursday, and we \n",
      "simply want to skip over that item.\n",
      "00:58:53: So, we added continue.\n",
      "00:58:54: So here you see it skips over and then \n",
      "we get Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n",
      "00:58:58: So once again you can use logic in your loops.\n",
      "00:59:01: You could also have it break and \n",
      "continue. So far throughout this video,  \n",
      "00:59:05: we've been looking at some of the fundamentals, \n",
      "and we've been writing all of our own code;  \n",
      "00:59:10: however, one thing you can do is you can \n",
      "build on top of what others have already done  \n",
      "00:59:15: using libraries and also modules, and there are \n",
      "lots of fantastic libraries that you can use.\n",
      "00:59:21: Let's say for instance that we \n",
      "want to print out the value of Pi.\n",
      "00:59:25: It turns out there's an \n",
      "existing library called math.\n",
      "00:59:28: We could simply type in import and type in math,  \n",
      "00:59:32: and right beneath that, let's use our standard \n",
      "print function, and here I'll type in print.\n",
      "00:59:37: And why don't we say something like pi is,  \n",
      "00:59:40: and then I'll insert a comma and here now I can \n",
      "refer to the math library and I'll type in .pi.\n",
      "00:59:47: So, I want to get the pi value back  \n",
      "00:59:49: and here as I'm typing that out, you'll see \n",
      "all sorts of suggestions of what I could use.\n",
      "00:59:54: So here when I click on run now, \n",
      "here it'll print out the value of pi.\n",
      "00:59:58: So once again, when you're programming, you don't \n",
      "necessarily have to write everything on your own.\n",
      "01:00:02: Instead, you can build on top of what others \n",
      "have done. If you were following along today,  \n",
      "01:00:08: you might have occasionally run into different \n",
      "errors as you were trying to execute your code  \n",
      "01:00:13: and they can really be a pain to resolve.\n",
      "01:00:15: I want to go through three of the key errors that \n",
      "you might run into and how you can resolve them.\n",
      "01:00:22: So, let's take one example.\n",
      "01:00:23: Here I'm going to type in print, \n",
      "and I'll type in Hello World.\n",
      "01:00:27: Now if you've been following along, you probably \n",
      "know that every time I type in this function,  \n",
      "01:00:31: and I type in text, I need to include my \n",
      "quotes around this, but I haven't done that.\n",
      "01:00:36: When I hit run right now, here I get an error,  \n",
      "01:00:39: and this is referred to as a syntax error \n",
      "and the reason why is, I didn't follow  \n",
      "01:00:44: the rules of the print function, or I \n",
      "didn't follow the syntax rules for Python.\n",
      "01:00:48: The best way to troubleshoot these \n",
      "is to simply look through your code  \n",
      "01:00:52: to find out where the error might be.\n",
      "01:00:54: So here I get name error \n",
      "hello world is not defined.\n",
      "01:00:57: So here it thinks hello world is a variable.\n",
      "01:01:00: So, this is one way where you can look at the \n",
      "error message down here and that'll help you  \n",
      "01:01:03: troubleshoot up above what the problem is. Now you \n",
      "might run into another type of error, let's say I  \n",
      "01:01:09: take 10 / 0 and then I try to run this, and we all \n",
      "know that you can't divide by zero. Right here I  \n",
      "01:01:16: get a zero-division error division by zero. This \n",
      "is referred to as a runtime error. It just fails.\n",
      "01:01:23: Now you could look down here at the error \n",
      "message to see what it was and that might  \n",
      "01:01:27: help you troubleshoot where the problem is in your \n",
      "code, and typically when you get an error message,  \n",
      "01:01:32: you could go to something like stackoverflow.com \n",
      "and you can look up your error message to see  \n",
      "01:01:37: if other people have encountered similar errors \n",
      "and that'll help you get down to the root cause.  \n",
      "01:01:42: And lastly, there's another type \n",
      "of error that you might encounter.\n",
      "01:01:46: Let's say I type in name equals. Let's say Kevin,  \n",
      "01:01:49: just like we did earlier and here now, let's \n",
      "say I want to print, and I'll say hello name.\n",
      "01:01:54: So, let's say I want to print the \n",
      "name that I assigned to this variable.\n",
      "01:01:58: Here let me insert the \n",
      "parentheses and then I'll hit run.\n",
      "01:02:02: So down here, it just says hello name, and it's \n",
      "not printing out Kevin. Now these errors here  \n",
      "01:02:08: these are referred to as semantic errors and \n",
      "these are notoriously hard to troubleshoot and  \n",
      "01:02:16: the reason why is because everything is working \n",
      "as it should based on how you programmed it.\n",
      "01:02:20: But you're not getting the expected result.\n",
      "01:02:23: So, for these you typically have to sit \n",
      "down, look through your code, evaluate  \n",
      "01:02:27: is everything working how it should, \n",
      "so these will tend to take more time.\n",
      "01:02:32: All right, well that now brings \n",
      "us to the end of this video.\n",
      "01:02:36: Hopefully by now you understand the \n",
      "fundamentals of programming using Python.\n",

      "00:01:31: To get started, you might be wondering, \n",
      "well, why should I even learn how to program?\n",
      "00:01:36: How is this going to benefit me?\n",
      "00:01:38: Well, anytime you go on your phone \n",
      "or anytime you go on your PC,  \n",
      "00:01:43: you're experiencing the output of \n",
      "something that someone has programmed.\n",
      "00:01:48: So, you're realizing the benefit.\n",
      "00:01:50: Think of it this way. To program allows you \n",
      "to take maybe an idea that's in your head,  \n",
      "00:01:56: you can turn it into a series of steps that \n",
      "the computer can understand and execute.\n",
      "00:02:01: How cool is that?\n",
      "00:02:03: So, for example, maybe you have \n",
      "a game that you want to create.\n",
      "00:02:06: Maybe you want to create an application at work \n",
      "to help simplify what you do on a daily basis.\n",
      "00:02:12: By programming, you can do all of those things.\n",
      "00:02:15: It's an incredibly powerful \n",
      "skill to learn how to use.\n",
      "00:02:24: OK, so you want to learn how \n",
      "to program, but why Python?\n",
      "00:02:29: There are so many different programming \n",
      "languages out there, you have C, C Sharp,  \n",
      "00:02:34: C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, \n",
      "and the list goes on and on.\n",

      "all of you what programming language do you  \n",
      "00:02:45: most want to learn about? And overwhelmingly, \n",
      "far and away, Python was the clear winner.  \n",
      "00:02:51: It was something like 65% of you wanted \n",
      "Python. And it kind of makes sense. When you  \n",
      "00:02:57: look at the lists of the most popular programming \n",
      "languages, Python tends to be right near the top.\n",
      "00:03:03: It's been around for a while.\n",
      "00:03:05: It's also pretty easy to use and also understand.  \n",
      "00:03:08: When you code using Python, it tends to \n",
      "be a very concise programming language.\n",
      "00:03:14: It's also a good general \n",
      "purpose programming language,  \n",
      "00:03:17: and what I mean by that, is you can \n",
      "write all sorts of applications.\n",
      "00:03:20: Maybe you want to write a web \n",
      "app, an internal company tool,  \n",
      "00:03:23: a game, or maybe you just want to \n",
      "conduct some scientific analysis.\n",
      "00:03:27: You can do all of that with Python.\n",
      "00:03:30: And all the things that you \n",
      "learn today related to Python,  \n",
      "00:03:34: you can take these same concepts and you can \n",
      "apply it to other programming languages as well.\n",
      "00:03:40: And really, fundamentally, you just \n",
      "want to take some idea you have,  \n",
      "00:03:45: you want to turn it into a series of \n",
      "steps that the computer can execute.\n",
      "00:03:49: And in a sense, it's kind of like a \n",
      "different language or a spoken language.\n",
      "00:03:53: So, in English I say hello, \n",
      "in German I'll say hallo,  \n",
      "00:03:57: and in French, I'll try my best, I'll say bonjour.\n",
      "00:04:00: And all of those communicate the same idea. \n",
      "I'm just saying hello, but it's a slightly  \n",
      "00:04:06: different way of saying it or speaking it, and \n",
      "that's the same with a programming language.\n",
      "00:04:12: They have different syntaxes. \n",
      "They also have different rules,  \n",
      "00:04:16: but at the end of the day, you're simply trying \n",
      "to communicate something to the computer,  \n",
      "00:04:20: because you want the computer to do something \n",
      "for you. Now of course, each programming language  \n",

      "you're really accomplishing the same objective.\n",
      "00:04:30: All right, so why don't we jump on the \n",
      "PC and let's get started with Python.\n",
      "00:04:39: Here I am now on my PC and first off I want \n",
      "to check if I already have Python installed.\n",
      "00:04:46: To do that on Windows 10, simply go down to your  \n",
      "00:04:49: taskbar and within the search \n",
      "field type in command prompt.\n",
      "00:04:53: Once you type in command \n",

      "00:04:57: This opens up your command \n",
      "prompt, and to check for Python,  \n",
      "00:05:00: simply type in Python and then type in --version.\n",
      "00:05:05: If you have Python installed, it'll tell you the \n",
      "version of Python that you have, and here you see,  \n",
      "00:05:11: I just typed this in and it says Python was \n",
      "not found, so I need to go and install Python.\n",
      "00:05:16: If you already have it, you can skip the \n",
      "next step. If you don't have Python like me,  \n",
      "00:05:21: stick around and I'll show \n",
      "you how you can get Python.  \n",
      "00:05:25: To get Python, head to the website python.org \n",
      "and that'll drop you on the Python home page.  \n",
      "00:05:31: Right near the top, you'll see a \n",
      "button right here for downloads.\n",
      "00:05:35: If you click on this, it'll identify \n",
      "what operating system you're on  \n",
      "00:05:39: and it'll recommend the best option.\n",
      "00:05:41: However, if you're on a different OS, you \n",
      "can also choose it down here. Now I'm running  \n",
      "00:05:46: Windows today, so I'll download Python 3.9.2. \n",
      "This is currently the most recent version. If  \n",
      "00:05:53: you're watching this video maybe a few months from \n",
      "now, there could be an even more recent version.\n",
      "00:05:58: Go ahead and download whichever \n",
      "one it recommends to you.\n",
      "00:06:01: I'll click on download and here it's \n",
      "kicked off the download process.\n",
      "00:06:04: Once you finish downloading, click on the EXE.\n",
      "00:06:07: This opens up the install prompt \n",
      "and right up here I could install.\n",
      "00:06:11: However, before we do that,  \n",
      "00:06:13: there’s an option right here at the \n",
      "bottom that says add Python to PATH.\n",
      "00:06:18: Let's check that box and \n",
      "then click on install now.\n",
      "00:06:21: This now runs through the installation \n",
      "process, and it looks like the setup  \n",
      "00:06:25: was successful, so I'm going to click on close.\n",
      "00:06:28: Let's now go down below and just like we \n",
      "did before, you can type in command prompt  \n",
      "00:06:32: and then launch the command prompt. \n",
      "Once again, we can type in Python  \n",
      "00:06:37: –version, hit enter, and you should now see that \n",
      "Python is installed. Here I have Python 3.9.2.\n",
      "00:06:44: OK, now that we've verified that Python is \n",
      "successfully installed, let's close command  \n",
      "00:06:48: prompt and once again, let's go down to the \n",
      "taskbar, except this time let's type in Python.\n",
      "00:06:54: And here you should see the best match for Python. \n",
      "Here I see Python 3.9. Let's click on this.\n",
      "00:07:00: This opens up the Python terminal, and I'll \n",
      "zoom in just a little bit, so it's a little  \n",
      "00:07:05: bit easier to see, and we can type in code \n",
      "directly here and Python will interpret it.\n",
      "00:07:12: So, what's an example of that?\n",
      "00:07:14: So, what if we type in what is 1 + 2 and I'll \n",
      "put a question mark in and let's hit enter.\n",
      "00:07:22: And this doesn't work.\n",
      "00:07:23: I see something that says \n",
      "syntax error, invalid syntax.\n",
      "00:07:28: Now the syntax is the rules of a programming \n",
      "language and when I typed in what is 1 + 2?\n",
      "00:07:35: This doesn't align with what Python is expecting.\n",
      "00:07:39: I need to type in a valid expression that \n",
      "the Python programming language understands.\n",
      "00:07:44: So, instead of typing in what is \n",
      "1 + 2, well I could just type in 1  \n",
      "00:07:49: and I'll type in + 2, and then I'll \n",
      "hit enter and there gives me 3 back,  \n",
      "00:07:53: so this was a valid expression in \n",
      "the Python programming language.\n",
      "00:07:59: Now, what's neat is when I type something \n",
      "into Python, like 1 + 2, Python takes each  \n",
      "00:08:04: line of code that I enter. So the 1 + 2, \n",
      "it interprets it, and then it evaluates it.\n",
      "00:08:10: So, it gave me 3.\n",
      "00:08:12: There are other programming languages \n",
      "where you have to compile it first  \n",
      "00:08:15: and then you can execute it, but with Python \n",
      "it'll interpret it as you’re going to.\n",
      "00:08:20: Now, now that we've typed in just a very \n",
      "basic expression, and we've evaluated it,  \n",
      "00:08:25: why don't we try a built-in function \n",
      "called print. Here I could type in print,  \n",
      "00:08:29: I'm going to open the parentheses, insert double \n",
      "quotes, and then I'll type in Hello World,  \n",
      "00:08:35: and I'll close my quotes and close my parentheses.\n",
      "00:08:37: Now this is one of the go to examples anytime \n",
      "you're starting with a new programming language.\n",
      "00:08:42: It's just hello world. Just testing it out.\n",
      "00:08:45: I'll hit enter and here it says Hello World, so \n",
      "it's sending back exactly what we sent into this  \n",
      "00:08:51: function. Now as we go throughout this, our \n",
      "programs are going to get a little bit more  \n",
      "00:08:55: complex, but this is just showing you the basics \n",
      "of how you can already start executing some code.  \n",
      "00:09:01: To exit out of the Python terminal, \n",
      "we can click on the X symbol up here  \n",
      "00:09:05: or we can type in another function called exit.\n",
      "00:09:08: Open your parentheses, close your parentheses,  \n",
      "00:09:10: then hit enter and that'll \n",
      "close out the terminal window.\n",
      "00:09:13: Now we executed some of our first code directly \n",
      "in the Python terminal, but you can also use  \n",
      "00:09:19: a text editor to write code. On Windows, \n",
      "there's a text editor called Notepad.\n",
      "00:09:25: Once again, go down to your taskbar and \n",
      "in the search field type in Notepad.\n",
      "00:09:29: I'll click on this right here.\n",
      "00:09:32: This opens up Notepad, and I'll zoom in \n",
      "just a little bit more. Now you probably  \n",
      "00:09:36: never knew that you can \n",
      "write source code in Notepad.\n",
      "00:09:38: It's actually a pretty powerful app. So right \n",
      "here, just like we did in the previous example,  \n",
      "00:09:43: I'll type in print and then I'll open \n",
      "my parentheses, put in a quote, and then  \n",
      "00:09:47: I'll type in Hello World once again, and then \n",
      "I'll close my quotes and close my parentheses.\n",
      "00:09:52: So, here's my source code written in Notepad.\n",
      "00:09:55: Now of course I want to be able to run this, so \n",
      "I need to save it as an appropriate file type.\n",
      "00:10:01: I'll go up to the file menu, go down to save \n",
      "as, and this opens up the save as prompt.\n",
      "00:10:06: Now maybe I'll just call this file, let's call \n",
      "it Hello World, and if I just leave it as that,  \n",
      "00:10:12: it'll save it as a .txt or basically \n",
      "just a standard text document.\n",
      "00:10:17: Now I want this to be a Python file and it \n",
      "turns out that the extension for Python is .py,  \n",
      "00:10:23: just like the extension for text files .txt, \n",
      "Python is .py, so here I'll type in .py.\n",
      "00:10:30: Depending on the programming \n",
      "language that you're using,  \n",
      "00:10:32: different programming languages \n",
      "have different extensions.\n",
      "00:10:35: For example, JavaScript is .js and every \n",
      "language will have its own extension.\n",
      "00:10:40: Now that I've typed this in, I'll save \n",
      "it to my desktop and then click on save.\n",
      "00:10:45: And here now I see the file on \n",
      "my desktop called Hello World.\n",
      "00:10:49: You'll also notice that it has the Python \n",
      "logo on it. Because we installed Python,  \n",
      "00:10:54: it correctly identifies that this is a .py \n",
      "file and so it sees that this is a Python file.\n",
      "00:11:00: Now let's test this out to see if we \n",
      "can run this source code that we wrote.  \n",
      "00:11:04: Down below on the taskbar, \n",
      "let's type in command prompt,  \n",
      "00:11:08: just like we did earlier, and \n",
      "let's open up the command prompt.\n",
      "00:11:11: I've adjusted the command prompt \n",
      "so it's a little bit easier to see,  \n",
      "00:11:14: and now I want to run this file \n",
      "over here in command prompt.\n",
      "00:11:18: To do that, let me type in Python.\n",
      "00:11:20: So, this will let the computer know that \n",
      "this is a Python file that I want to run.\n",
      "00:11:24: I'll put in a space, and I'll take my Python file,  \n",
      "00:11:27: and then I'll simply drag and \n",
      "drop it over into command prompt.\n",
      "00:11:30: Now this is a really cool trick  \n",
      "00:11:32: where you can get the location of the file \n",
      "simply by dragging and dropping it in.\n",
      "00:11:36: So here basically I'm saying I \n",
      "want to execute this Python file.\n",
      "00:11:40: Next, I'll click on enter and here we see that \n",
      "it prints hello world into my command prompt.\n",
      "00:11:46: This is exactly what I wanted it \n",
      "to do, so Python went through,  \n",
      "00:11:50: and it interpreted the code in this file \n",
      "and then it printed it here on my screen.\n",
      "00:11:55: You now know some of the basics of \n",
      "both writing and running Python code.\n",
      "00:12:00: Congratulations, you just wrote your first \n",
      "bit of source code, and you also ran it.\n",
      "00:12:06: You're making some good progress.\n",
      "00:12:08: Now, so far, we've just been writing \n",
      "our code in a text editor like Notepad,  \n",
      "00:12:13: and then we've been running it, \n",
      "and that works perfectly fine,  \n",
      "00:12:17: but it's not the most efficient way to write \n",
      "code, and I just want to give a parallel example.\n",
      "00:12:23: Let's say that maybe you're \n",
      "writing a document for school.\n",
      "00:12:26: You could write your document in Notepad. \n",
      "Now of course it does have some downsides.\n",
      "00:12:31: You don't have a spell check.\n",
      "00:12:33: You don't have a grammar \n",
      "check. You can't do formatting.\n",
      "00:12:35: So, although you can do it, it's \n",
      "going to require a lot more work.\n",
      "00:12:39: And that same concept also applies to programming.\n",
      "00:12:43: Sure, you could write your code in Notepad, \n",
      "or we can get what's called an IDE,  \n",
      "00:12:48: and that stands for integrated \n",
      "development environment.\n",
      "00:12:51: It'll just make writing code a \n",
      "lot more efficient and also easy,  \n",
      "00:12:55: and in a few moments, we'll see why that is.\n",
      "00:12:59: You have all sorts of IDEs \n",
      "that you can choose from.  \n",
      "00:13:02: On Apple, you have Xcode. On Android, you have \n",
      "Android Studio. With Ruby, you have RubyMine,  \n",
      "00:13:08: and there's also another one called Visual \n",
      "Studio Code and that works very well with Python.\n",
      "00:13:13: It's a product made by Microsoft, so of \n",
      "course I like it. I used to work at Microsoft,  \n",
      "00:13:17: but the great thing too is Visual \n",
      "Studio Code is entirely free,  \n",
      "00:13:21: so let's go to Visual Studio \n",
      "Code and let's get this IDE.\n",
      "00:13:25: To get Visual Studio Code, head to \n",
      "the website code.visualstudio.com  \n",
      "00:13:31: and once you land on the homepage, you can \n",
      "choose the operating system that you have.  \n",
      "00:13:36: Here when I click on the drop \n",
      "down, you can get it on Mac,  \n",

      "this file and here it prints out hello world.\n",
      "00:17:48: So, it gives me the output \n",

      "running the Python file in the terminal there,  \n",

      "here too I see hello world.\n",
      "00:18:08: So, this is just another way, probably a little \n",
      "bit easier to see the output of your code.\n",
      "00:18:14: Now that we know some of the basics of how to \n",
      "start writing code and how to run that code,  \n",
      "00:18:19: I want to show you how we can start working \n",

      "00:18:29: the terminal and just like we did earlier \n",
      "in the Python terminal, I can type in here.\n",
      "00:18:33: So here I'll type in 1 + 2  \n",
      "00:18:36: and I'll hit enter and here it interprets \n",
      "that code, and it evaluates it to 3.\n",
      "00:18:40: So just like we saw earlier. One of the \n",
      "things is you'll notice when I typed in 1 + 2,  \n",
      "00:18:45: I didn't include any spaces and spaces or \n",
      "whitespace don't impact the calculation at all,  \n",
      "00:18:51: so I could also type in 1, space, and I'll type \n",
      "in plus, and then another space, and hit 2,  \n",
      "00:18:56: and then hit enter and there too it also evaluates \n",
      "it to 3, so using white space can actually make  \n",
      "00:19:02: your code more readable, so you could type it \n",
      "in like this, or just include some white space.\n",
      "00:19:06: It won't affect what the outcome is. With \n",
      "Python, I can use all of the standard  \n",
      "00:19:12: operators. Right up above, I showed you how \n",
      "you can do addition, but here let's say 5 – 2,  \n",
      "00:19:18: I can also do subtraction, and here \n",
      "it evaluates that to 3 as well.\n",
      "00:19:22: I could do a multiplication, so let's say 4 * 4.\n",
      "00:19:25: Now with multiplication, I enter in an asterisk.\n",
      "00:19:28: That's the multiplication symbol.\n",
      "00:19:30: Here I'll hit enter and it evaluates that to 16. I \n",
      "could also do division. Here I'll take 10 / 5 and  \n",
      "00:19:36: here for division, division is the forward slash, \n",
      "and then I'll hit enter and that evaluates to 2.\n",
      "00:19:42: Now with Python, let's say that \n",
      "you start using multiple operators,  \n",
      "00:19:46: so maybe you're adding and \n",
      "then you're multiplying.\n",
      "00:19:48: Python follows the default order of operations,  \n",
      "00:19:51: so let's say I enter in 2 + 2 \n",
      "and then I want to multiply by 5.\n",
      "00:19:57: What do you think this will evaluate to?\n",
      "00:19:59: Is it 2 + 2 which is 4 and \n",
      "then times 5 which is 20?\n",
      "00:20:02: Or is it 2 * 5 which is 10, and \n",
      "then you add 2 to that which is 12.\n",
      "00:20:06: Well here if I hit enter, it evaluates to 12,  \n",
      "00:20:09: because it's following the default order of \n",
      "operations. Multiplication comes before addition.\n",
      "00:20:16: If you've ever heard PEMDAS or Please Excuse \n",
      "My Dear Aunt Sally before, that's how you  \n",
      "00:20:22: know what the order of operations is. First \n",
      "it'll evaluate whatever is in parentheses.\n",
      "00:20:27: Then it'll look at any exponents followed by \n",
      "multiplication and division in the order of left  \n",
      "00:20:33: to right, and then it'll look at addition and \n",
      "subtraction also in the order of left to right.\n",
      "00:20:38: Up above, I could also enter \n",
      "in my expression up here,  \n",
      "00:20:41: so here I'll get rid of hello world and \n",
      "here I'll say let's print out 2 + 2.\n",
      "00:20:46: Here I'll click on run and here \n",
      "you'll see that it executes this  \n",
      "00:20:49: code Thanks for the suggestion! I’ve added this \n",
      "to my list. Stay tuned. Cheers!and here this also  \n",
      "00:20:51: evaluates to 4. If I want to use an exponent, \n",
      "I'll come up here. Let's remove the plus symbol,  \n",
      "00:20:57: and here I'll enter 2 asterisks, so \n",
      "this will be 2 to the power of 2.\n",
      "00:21:03: And here if I click on the play button, \n",
      "here that evaluates to four 2 * 2 is 4.\n",
      "00:21:08: But let's say I want to do a 2 to the 3rd.\n",
      "00:21:10: Here I'll evaluate and it comes out to 8. \n",
      "I also have access to the floor operator,  \n",
      "00:21:16: so let's take an example here. Let's say I \n",
      "want to calculate 5 / 2, and here I'll play  \n",
      "00:21:23: and right down here I see that's \n",
      "2.5, so I have a remainder of .5.\n",
      "00:21:27: But let's say I don't want to \n",
      "know what the remainder is.\n",
      "00:21:29: I just want to know how many times \n",
      "it goes in without a remainder.\n",
      "00:21:32: This is also known as the floor.\n",
      "00:21:34: I could insert another forward slash and then I \n",
      "could run it and here it tells me that it’s 2.\n",
      "00:21:40: But let's say I just want to \n",
      "know what the remainder is,  \n",
      "00:21:43: I can use the modulus operator for that.\n",
      "00:21:46: I'll get rid of the forward slashes, and \n",
      "right here, I'll type in the percent symbol,  \n",
      "00:21:51: then I'll hit go and here it \n",
      "tells me that the remainder is 1.\n",
      "00:21:55: As I'm entering in numbers up above \n",
      "and as I'm working with numbers,  \n",
      "00:21:58: let's say that I enter a very large number. \n",
      "So, let's say I enter in maybe 1,000,000.\n",
      "00:22:03: Now I could go through here and I could \n",
      "enter a comma and then I'll type in the zeros  \n",
      "00:22:08: and if I hit go here, you'll notice that \n",
      "it doesn't print what I expect it to.\n",
      "00:22:13: That's because we don't want to use \n",
      "commas as we're entering numbers.\n",
      "00:22:16: Instead, when you enter a number,  \n",
      "00:22:18: just enter it in as is and then hit go, \n",
      "and here it prints exactly what we expect.\n",
      "00:22:23: So, you don't want to use commas \n",
      "when you're entering in numbers.\n",
      "00:22:26: Now that we've entered in some numbers, and \n",
      "we know a little bit about the basics of  \n",
      "00:22:30: how you can work with numbers and operators,  \n",
      "00:22:32: let's start working with some text \n",
      "or what's referred to as strings.\n",
      "00:22:37: Let's say that I want to print what's up. \n",
      "Now earlier, we printed out hello world  \n",
      "00:22:42: and it's the same concept here. I'll insert in \n",
      "double quotes and then I'll type in what's up.\n",
      "00:22:47: So, here's what's up and I'll click on this play  \n",
      "00:22:50: icon and down below you'll see \n",
      "that the output is what's up.\n",
      "00:22:53: Now I surrounded what's up with double \n",
      "quotes. Now instead of using double quotes,  \n",
      "00:22:58: I can also use single quotes up here.\n",
      "00:23:01: So, if I enter in single quotes and then hit play, \n",
      "here too, you'll see that I get the same output,  \n",
      "00:23:06: so I can choose whether I want to \n",
      "use double quotes or single quotes.\n",
      "00:23:10: So why would I want to use \n",
      "one versus the other? Well,  \n",
      "00:23:13: here, what's up should actually have a single \n",
      "quote, so I'll insert a single quote there.\n",
      "00:23:18: Now one of the problems is when I enter \n",
      "a single quote here, it thinks that this  \n",
      "00:23:22: is the end of the string, and so now if I try \n",
      "to run it, I get a syntax error down below.\n",
      "00:23:27: So instead, I can use double quotes here \n",
      "and I'll use double quotes at the end,  \n",
      "00:23:31: and I could use a single quote in the middle \n",
      "and then here I'll run it and it works properly.\n",
      "00:23:36: Now let's say you wanted to use \n",
      "double quotes within your text.\n",
      "00:23:39: Well, you could surround it with single quotes \n",
      "and that way the double quotes would show up.\n",
      "00:23:44: Now here too, just like we saw before, \n",
      "whitespace doesn't impact how the code runs,  \n",
      "00:23:49: so if I want to insert a space here and maybe \n",
      "insert a space there and another space here  \n",
      "00:23:53: and I run this code, here you'll see \n",
      "that I get the exact same output.\n",
      "00:23:58: So once again, by using white space,  \n",
      "00:24:00: that can help make your code more \n",
      "readable as you're going through.\n",
      "00:24:05: We now know some of the basics of \n",
      "working with numbers and also strings,  \n",
      "00:24:09: but what if you want to make sure you \n",
      "explain what's happening in your code?\n",
      "00:24:13: How do we do that?\n",
      "00:24:14: Well, we can use something called a comment, \n",
      "so let's say that I have this code here and I  \n",
      "00:24:18: want to explain to someone what this does. Here \n",
      "I’ll bring this code down to the second line and  \n",
      "00:24:24: I can insert a comment by entering in the hash \n",
      "symbol or the number sign or the pound symbol,  \n",
      "00:24:30: so I'll enter that and here I \n",
      "can say this prints some text.\n",
      "00:24:36: I've now typed in my comment \n",
      "and let's run this now  \n",
      "00:24:39: and here you'll see that this doesn't \n",
      "affect at all what appears down here.\n",
      "00:24:43: I simply get what's up.\n",
      "00:24:44: So just like we got before. Now I could also take \n",
      "a comment and I could put it on a line with code.\n",
      "00:24:49: So here I'll put it after my code,  \n",
      "00:24:51: I'll hit run, and here too you see \n",
      "that it just gives me what's up.\n",
      "00:24:55: Now one of the neat things is,  \n",
      "00:24:56: let's say I start writing a lot of code \n",
      "and it's starting to get fairly complex.\n",
      "00:25:01: I can comment out a line of code.\n",
      "00:25:03: I'll put the hash symbol in front of my \n",
      "code and here you see it turns green,  \n",
      "00:25:08: so this is the IDE’s way of \n",
      "telling me that this is a comment.\n",
      "00:25:11: And here now, if I hit run, you'll see that I \n",
      "get no output. That's because I commented out  \n",
      "00:25:16: this line of code, so here I could bring it \n",
      "back by removing it and now here if I run it  \n",
      "00:25:21: once again it shows me what’s up. So comments \n",
      "are pretty valuable as you're writing code.  \n",
      "00:25:26: Not only to let other people know what's happening \n",
      "in your code and what different blocks of code do,  \n",
      "00:25:31: but you can also use it when \n",
      "you're troubleshooting to  \n",
      "00:25:34: cancel out certain areas of your code \n",
      "until you're ready to test them again.\n",
      "00:25:38: Next, we're going to look at \n",
      "how you can use variables,  \n",
      "00:25:42: and the easiest way to explain a variable is to \n",
      "use this red bucket that I have here from my son.\n",
      "00:25:50: So, let's pretend that this red bucket here \n",
      "is a variable and we can name the variable.\n",
      "00:25:55: Why don't we just call it red \n",
      "bucket, just to keep things simple.\n",
      "00:25:59: Now I can assign a value to this \n",
      "variable, so let's take for instance.\n",
      "00:26:04: Let's say I want the red \n",
      "bucket to equal my name Kevin.\n",
      "00:26:07: So here I have my name.\n",
      "00:26:09: I can take this value and I \n",
      "can assign it to this variable.\n",
      "00:26:13: So now if you say well, what \n",
      "is the red bucket, well,  \n",
      "00:26:15: right here the red bucket is currently Kevin.\n",
      "00:26:18: So once again, I've assigned that value to it.\n",
      "00:26:20: And this is a string or basically \n",
      "my name is referred to as a string.\n",
      "00:26:25: It's just a set of characters.\n",
      "00:26:27: Now I could assign other types of data to \n",
      "this variable as well, so maybe I say, well,  \n",
      "00:26:31: actually I want the red bucket now to equal \n",
      "a number, so maybe I want it to equal #8.\n",
      "00:26:36: So, I'm going to say red bucket, you're now \n",
      "equal to 8, so I'm going to take my name.\n",
      "00:26:40: We're going to pull that out, and here I'll take \n",
      "the number 8 and we'll put it in the bucket.\n",
      "00:26:45: So now if you ask me, well what is the red bucket?\n",
      "00:26:47: Well, it's currently the number 8.\n",
      "00:26:49: That's a general concept of a variable.\n",
      "00:26:52: The variable can hold different values.\n",
      "00:26:54: Let's jump in now and see how we can \n",
      "use variables. To create variables,  \n",
      "00:26:58: there are some rules that we need to follow, \n",
      "or this is the syntax that Python looks for.\n",
      "00:27:04: A variable should only contain \n",
      "letters, numbers or underscores.\n",
      "00:27:08: And also, we just need to make sure \n",
      "that we don't start with a number.\n",
      "00:27:12: We can't use any spaces in a variable name.\n",
      "00:27:14: We also can't use any known keywords \n",
      "to Python like break or try.\n",
      "00:27:19: And ideally, we want to make sure that a \n",
      "variable name is short and descriptive.\n",
      "00:27:24: Those work best.\n",
      "00:27:26: So, for example, with the red bucket, \n",
      "we'll now simply call the red bucket,  \n",
      "00:27:29: so it's pretty short and also descriptive.\n",
      "00:27:31: Also, variable names are case sensitive, so if \n",
      "I wrote red bucket with a capital R and another  \n",
      "00:27:37: one with a lowercase r, Python would view those as \n",
      "separate variables, so case sensitivity matters.\n",
      "00:27:45: OK, so let's create our first variable \n",
      "and just continuing the example,  \n",
      "00:27:49: let's say I want the variable to be called \n",
      "red bucket, so I'll give it this name  \n",
      "00:27:54: and now I need to assign a value to this variable, \n",
      "just like I did with the bucket. I'll type in  \n",
      "00:28:00: red_bucket and I'll type in the equal sign and I'm \n",
      "going to assign it the value of Kevin, my name.\n",
      "00:28:07: And here I'm using just a single equals sign. So,  \n",
      "00:28:10: what this does is it will assign \n",
      "this value to this variable.\n",
      "00:28:15: So now here I could hit enter and let me \n",
      "run this and here nothing shows up yet  \n",
      "00:28:19: because I've assigned this value to this variable.\n",
      "00:28:22: The next thing we could do \n",
      "is actually print this out.\n",
      "00:28:25: So here let me say print and \n",
      "let's type in red bucket.\n",
      "00:28:28: What's nice is because I'm using \n",
      "an IDE, it recognizes that I  \n",
      "00:28:33: created a variable called red bucket \n",
      "and I can just click on it here.\n",
      "00:28:37: Now if I click on the play icon, \n",
      "here it'll print out Kevin,  \n",
      "00:28:41: so it's printing out the value \n",
      "that's assigned to the red bucket.\n",
      "00:28:45: Now let's take another example here, \n",
      "let's say I add another line and  \n",
      "00:28:49: let me copy this first line and \n",
      "I'll paste it into the second line.\n",
      "00:28:53: And here I want to assign 10 to the red bucket.\n",
      "00:28:56: So here I start out by assigning \n",
      "Kevin and then I assign 10.\n",
      "00:29:00: What do you think will print out?\n",
      "00:29:02: Let's click on the play icon \n",
      "and here it prints out 10.\n",
      "00:29:05: And the reason why is, well, first \n",
      "it assigns Kevin to Red bucket,  \n",
      "00:29:08: and so that's the current value. But then \n",
      "on the next line of code, it assigns a 10  \n",
      "00:29:13: to the red bucket. So, the 10 overwrites Kevin, \n",
      "and then when I print out the red bucket,  \n",
      "00:29:19: it's taking the last value that was assigned \n",
      "to it. So, the way to think of this back to  \n",
      "00:29:23: the bucket example is I put Kevin in the bucket \n",
      "and then when I put 10 in, I have to take Kevin  \n",
      "00:29:28: out and then I put 10 in, so at the very end \n",
      "when you ask well what's in the red bucket,  \n",
      "00:29:32: well, the number 10 is the in the red bucket \n",
      "because that's the last item that I put in.\n",
      "00:29:37: One thing that's really neat about Python \n",
      "is when you're defining your variables,  \n",
      "00:29:42: you don't have to assign your variable a type.\n",
      "00:29:45: So here for example, for the red \n",
      "bucket, I assigned it my name,  \n",
      "00:29:48: and that's also known as a string.\n",
      "00:29:51: And next I assigned a number, which is an \n",
      "integer, but I don't have to go and say,  \n",
      "00:29:55: well, the red bucket is a string \n",
      "or a red bucket is an integer,  \n",
      "00:29:59: it'll automatically know what data type \n",
      "that I'm assigning to that variable.\n",
      "00:30:04: So down here in print, I can type in type  \n",
      "00:30:07: and then I'll open and close the \n",
      "parentheses around this variable.\n",
      "00:30:11: And so now let's run this and here \n",
      "it's telling me that it's an integer.\n",
      "00:30:15: So basically here 10 is assigned to red bucket,  \n",
      "00:30:18: and so it's telling me that \n",
      "that's currently an integer.\n",
      "00:30:20: Let's get rid of this line right here.\n",
      "00:30:22: So now Kevin will be assigned to Red Bucket.\n",
      "00:30:25: And when I run this, here you'll see that a \n",
      "string data type is assigned to this variable.\n",
      "00:30:30: Now let's say that I want \n",
      "to get rid of a variable,  \n",
      "00:30:33: so maybe I don't have a need \n",
      "for the red bucket anymore.\n",
      "00:30:36: Down here I can type in del, basically \n",
      "delete and this will delete a variable,  \n",
      "00:30:41: and here I can type in red bucket \n",
      "again. I'll select the suggestion.\n",
      "00:30:45: Let me get rid of the type in the print, so I just \n",
      "want to know what is red bucket? So if we run this  \n",
      "00:30:51: now, I'll get an error because it says red bucket \n",
      "is not defined and that makes sense because here I  \n",
      "00:30:56: created the variable, I assigned the value, here I \n",
      "deleted the variable, and here I try to print the  \n",
      "00:31:01: variable, but there is no variable anymore called \n",
      "red bucket because I deleted it right up above.\n",
      "00:31:06: Next, I want to show you an \n",
      "example of how you can request  \n",
      "00:31:10: input and then you can take that \n",
      "input and assign it to a variable.\n",
      "00:31:14: So right here I simply typed in Kevin \n",
      "and I assigned it to this red bucket,  \n",
      "00:31:18: but I want to allow input. So right up here, \n",
      "let's delete Kevin or delete your name that  \n",
      "00:31:22: you entered in and here we'll type in the input \n",
      "function. Here I'll open the parentheses and let  \n",
      "00:31:28: me type in double quotes and maybe I'll ask the \n",
      "question what do you want to put in the bucket.  \n",
      "00:31:33: I'll enter a question mark \n",
      "and then an additional space.  \n",
      "00:31:37: Now right down here, I don't want to delete \n",
      "the variable, so I'll get rid of this.\n",
      "00:31:40: So right now, I'm going to ask for input and \n",
      "then we'll print out whatever the input is.\n",
      "00:31:45: So here let's click on the \n",
      "run icon and this will run it.  \n",
      "00:31:49: Right down here it says what do \n",
      "you want to put in the bucket?\n",
      "00:31:51: And so maybe I want to put a shovel in,  \n",
      "00:31:53: so I'll click down in the terminal, \n",
      "type in shovel, and then hit enter.  \n",
      "00:31:57: And here now it prints out shovel, because \n",
      "that's now the value of the red bucket variable.\n",
      "00:32:04: Next, I want to show you how we can start \n",
      "using conditional logic in our code.\n",
      "00:32:09: Basically, any expression that you enter \n",
      "in breaks down to either true or false,  \n",
      "00:32:14: so let's just take an example.\n",
      "00:32:15: I'll go down a few lines and let me enter in \n",
      "print and I'm going to ask is 5 equal to 4?\n",
      "00:32:22: One of the things you'll notice is when \n",
      "I ask this question is 5 equals to 4,  \n",
      "00:32:26: I entered in two equal \n",
      "signs and that's not a typo.\n",
      "00:32:30: Up above, I just entered in one equal sign.\n",
      "00:32:33: So why do I enter one here \n",
      "and down here I enter two?\n",
      "00:32:36: Well up above, I'm taking this value or this \n",
      "input and I'm assigning it to this variable.\n",
      "00:32:42: Here I want to run a test for equality.\n",
      "00:32:45: I basically want to check are these two equal,  \n",
      "00:32:48: and when you test or check for \n",
      "equality, you use two equal signs,  \n",
      "00:32:53: so here let me remove the code up on top and \n",
      "I'm simply going to print out is 5 equal to 4.\n",
      "00:32:58: Here when I run it, here \n",
      "we'll see that no, it's false.\n",
      "00:33:01: 5 does not equal 4.\n",
      "00:33:03: Now you might be saying, well \n",
      "of course 5 isn't equal to 4.\n",
      "00:33:06: It's not equal to, so over here I can also \n",
      "check are they not equal to one another.\n",
      "00:33:10: So here instead of the equal sign, \n",
      "I'll insert an exclamation mark.\n",
      "00:33:14: So here I have an exclamation \n",
      "mark followed by an equal sign.\n",
      "00:33:17: So, this is my way of asking the \n",
      "computer is 5 not equal to 4?\n",
      "00:33:21: And I think we all know that's true.\n",
      "00:33:22: So, when I run it, here I get true back.  \n",
      "00:33:25: Along with equal to and not equal to, there \n",
      "are many other operators that I can also use.\n",
      "00:33:30: I have less than, greater than, greater \n",
      "than or equal to, and less than or equal to.\n",
      "00:33:35: And here you can see the symbol that you \n",
      "can use for these different operations  \n",
      "00:33:40: and over on the right-hand side, you'll see a few \n",
      "examples of how you could use this, so I could  \n",
      "00:33:44: insert any one of these into that print statement \n",
      "and you'll get this corresponding result.\n",
      "00:33:49: We can now take these different \n",
      "operations and we can combine it with  \n",
      "00:33:53: variables that we just learned about \n",
      "and so let's type in an example here.\n",
      "00:33:58: So, I have a young son at home. His name \n",
      "is Thomas and he's just three years old,  \n",
      "00:34:02: so let me create a variable and I'll call it \n",
      "Thomas age and it's currently equal to three,  \n",
      "00:34:07: so I'm taking this value of three and \n",
      "I'm assigning it to this variable.\n",
      "00:34:12: Now let's say I want to check, well, \n",
      "is he old enough for kindergarten.\n",
      "00:34:16: So maybe I type in age at and \n",
      "I'll type in kindergarten.\n",
      "00:34:21: And maybe age at kindergarten \n",
      "is 5, so I'll enter in equals 5,  \n",
      "00:34:25: so I now have two different variables and I've \n",
      "assigned a value to each of those variables.\n",
      "00:34:30: Now down here I can check the equality of these,  \n",
      "00:34:33: so maybe I'll say print and let's check is Thomas \n",
      "age, is that equivalent to the age at kindergarten  \n",
      "00:34:42: and so then I'll hit run and here we'll see \n",
      "that's false because basically Thomas age is  \n",
      "00:34:47: coming back as three, age at kindergarten \n",
      "is 5, and those don't equal one another.\n",
      "00:34:52: So, we can do this same type of check \n",
      "except we could do it using variables.  \n",
      "00:34:57: Now with this expression here, I'm simply checking  \n",
      "00:35:00: is Thomas’ age equal to the age at \n",
      "kindergarten and it comes back as false.\n",
      "00:35:05: But what if I want to do something \n",
      "a little bit more complex?\n",
      "00:35:08: What if I want to check, well if Thomas is \n",
      "less than the age at kindergarten, well,  \n",
      "00:35:12: he should probably be in preschool or daycare. \n",
      "And if he is 5, he should be in kindergarten.\n",
      "00:35:16: But if he's older than five, he \n",
      "should be in some other class.\n",
      "00:35:19: And right now, this is just doing one \n",
      "check, it's just looking at one point,  \n",
      "00:35:23: is he at the age for kindergarten?\n",
      "00:35:25: The easiest way to think of this is like \n",
      "a flow chart, so here I have the current  \n",
      "00:35:29: age and depending on his age, any one of \n",
      "these different scenarios could be true.\n",
      "00:35:34: Now I won't be able to do that with \n",
      "the simple expression that we wrote.\n",
      "00:35:37: That's just checking one thing.\n",
      "00:35:39: If I want to check multiple different criteria, \n",
      "this is when I can use an if statement.\n",
      "00:35:45: So, let's jump back into Visual Studio \n",
      "Code and let's look at how we can use this.  \n",
      "00:35:49: Back in Visual Studio, I'm going to delete this \n",
      "last line and I'll keep these two variables.\n",
      "00:35:54: The one with Thomas' age and the \n",
      "other one with the age at kindergarten  \n",
      "00:35:58: and I'll enter down a few lines. Once \n",
      "again, the white space doesn't matter,  \n",
      "00:36:02: so don't worry, you could enter \n",
      "down a few lines and now we want to  \n",
      "00:36:05: enter in an if statement. An if statement is \n",
      "really easy to write, you simply type in if.\n",
      "00:36:12: And here now I can do my check.\n",
      "00:36:15: So first I want to know is Thomas’ \n",
      "age less than the age at kindergarten?\n",
      "00:36:19: So here I can type in my variable.\n",
      "00:36:21: Once again it gives me this helpful suggestion \n",
      "of using Thomas’ age and first I can check if  \n",
      "00:36:27: he's younger than the age at kindergarten, \n",
      "so let me enter in the age at kindergarten.\n",
      "00:36:31: So, this is going to be my first check.\n",
      "00:36:34: Once I finish entering in this \n",
      "statement, I need to enter in a colon.\n",
      "00:36:38: And when I hit enter, this \n",
      "drops me down to the next line.\n",
      "00:36:41: One thing you'll notice is it \n",
      "automatically indented the line.\n",
      "00:36:45: What will happen is it will check this and if it \n",
      "turns out that Thomas’ age is less than the age  \n",
      "00:36:51: at kindergarten. In this case, Thomas is 3, the \n",
      "age of kindergarten is 5, so this would be true.\n",
      "00:36:56: It's going to evaluate this code, \n",
      "so whatever code I enter in here,  \n",
      "00:37:01: it'll go through and it'll execute that.\n",
      "00:37:04: So, let's test this out and let me type \n",
      "in print, so I'll enter in this function  \n",
      "00:37:08: and maybe we say something like \n",
      "Thomas should be in preschool.\n",
      "00:37:12: Once I finish typing that in, I'll go to \n",
      "the end of this line and hit enter again.\n",
      "00:37:17: Here you see that it continues to indent it.\n",
      "00:37:20: So basically, I can type in additional code \n",
      "and whatever I type in in this indented space,  \n",
      "00:37:26: it'll go through and it'll \n",
      "execute all of this code.\n",
      "00:37:30: Now I don't have anything else I want to run.\n",
      "00:37:32: I simply want to print out this message.\n",
      "00:37:34: Let's now test this out to see how it works.\n",
      "00:37:36: I'll go up here and click on run and here we get \n",
      "the text that says Thomas should be in preschool.\n",
      "00:37:42: Now let's say that maybe Thomas is 10 now.\n",
      "00:37:44: So here Thomas’ age is 10 and that is \n",
      "not less than the age of kindergarten.\n",
      "00:37:48: So, when I run, here I get nothing back because \n",
      "it evaluates this, and it comes back as false,  \n",
      "00:37:55: so it doesn't execute this code.\n",
      "00:37:57: Now there's nothing else here, \n",
      "so it simply returns nothing.  \n",
      "00:38:01: Now let's say I want some fall back, so let's say \n",
      "if this is false, I want to say something else.  \n",
      "00:38:06: Down here I can use else, so it'll check \n",
      "this, and it'll check if this is true,  \n",
      "00:38:11: but if it turns out being false, \n",
      "then it'll fall back to else.\n",
      "00:38:16: So here I'll enter an else, a colon, \n",
      "and here again it indents out.\n",
      "00:38:20: So here I could say, well if this isn't \n",
      "true then execute this block of code.\n",
      "00:38:25: So here maybe I'll insert another print function.\n",
      "00:38:28: So let me type in print.\n",
      "00:38:29: I'll open up the parentheses and let me type in \n",
      "Thomas should be in kindergarten or another class.\n",
      "00:38:36: So, I've now typed in my else statement, so \n",
      "let's try running it to see what it will happen.\n",
      "00:38:40: So, it'll check the first if statement,  \n",
      "00:38:42: that'll evaluates a false, and \n",
      "then it should fall back to else.\n",
      "00:38:46: Let's test this out. So when I hit \n",
      "run, here it says Thomas should be  \n",
      "00:38:50: in kindergarten or another class, so this \n",
      "logic is working exactly as we expect it to.\n",
      "00:38:56: Right now, I have two conditions here.\n",
      "00:38:58: I basically checked the first condition and if \n",
      "this is false, it just falls back to this one.\n",
      "00:39:03: But let's say I want to check \n",
      "for additional conditions.\n",
      "00:39:07: Here I'll enter down and let me get out of this \n",
      "block of code, so I'll hit the backspace key,  \n",
      "00:39:12: and right here, I can enter something \n",
      "called elif, basically else if,  \n",
      "00:39:16: so, you can go through and \n",
      "check any number of conditions.\n",
      "00:39:19: It'll start at the top and \n",
      "when it finds one that's true,  \n",
      "00:39:21: it'll display that message and then exit.\n",
      "00:39:24: But if this is false, it'll go to the \n",
      "next one and check that condition,  \n",
      "00:39:27: and I can add any number of else ifs in here.\n",
      "00:39:31: So I'll type in elif and maybe for this \n",
      "condition I want to know if Thomas is 5,  \n",
      "00:39:36: well he should be in kindergarten.\n",
      "00:39:38: So here I'll say Thomas age and here once again,  \n",
      "00:39:41: I want to check if it's equal \n",
      "to the age at kindergarten.\n",
      "00:39:44: And remember, we don't enter in one equal sign,  \n",
      "00:39:46: we enter in two and here I'll enter in \n",
      "the other variable age at kindergarten.\n",
      "00:39:50: So, this is going to be my check.\n",
      "00:39:52: And if this is true, we now want to evaluate \n",
      "some code. Now just like we did before where  \n",
      "00:39:56: I entered the colon, let's make sure \n",
      "we enter in a colon here at the end.\n",
      "00:40:00: That's part of Python syntax.\n",
      "00:40:02: I'll hit enter and this automatically indents me.  \n",
      "00:40:05: Here I'll type in print, and I'll type in \n",
      "some text that says enjoy kindergarten.\n",
      "00:40:10: Now I've added this else if statement that \n",
      "checks to see if he's in kindergarten.\n",
      "00:40:14: So, this last statement no longer makes sense \n",
      "where I say Thomas should be in kindergarten or  \n",
      "00:40:19: another class, so maybe I simply remove this \n",
      "and I say Thomas should be in another class,  \n",
      "00:40:26: so this will just be my catch all at the end.\n",
      "00:40:28: So, let's test this out to see how it works.\n",
      "00:40:30: So, let's say Thomas is 3 and I run it.\n",
      "00:40:33: In this case, the first condition here is true.\n",
      "00:40:36: So, Thomas should be in preschool \n",
      "and here I get the text down below.\n",
      "00:40:39: Thomas should be in preschool.  \n",
      "00:40:41: Now let's say Thomas is equal to five, \n",
      "or maybe he's five years old now.\n",
      "00:40:44: When we run it, here the first condition \n",
      "is false, so it skips over that one.\n",
      "00:40:48: It looks at the second condition,  \n",
      "00:40:50: this elif, and here Thomas is 5 \n",
      "and that's the age at kindergarten.\n",
      "00:40:54: So here I get the text saying enjoy kindergarten.\n",
      "00:40:57: And let's say now that maybe Thomas is 10.\n",
      "00:41:00: So here when I run it, it evaluates \n",
      "the first statement and, well,  \n",
      "00:41:03: he's older than the age of \n",
      "kindergarten, so that's false.\n",
      "00:41:05: His age is not equal to the age of \n",
      "kindergarten, so that's also false,  \n",
      "00:41:09: and then it falls back to the else statement, \n",
      "and so Thomas should be in another class.\n",
      "00:41:13: So here we've just tested that this \n",
      "is working just like we expect it to.\n",
      "00:41:17: Next, I want to show you how we can use \n",
      "functions in Python and if you've ever  \n",
      "00:41:23: used any other programming language before, you \n",
      "might know them as a subroutine or a method,  \n",
      "00:41:28: but it's all the same thing, so \n",
      "we're going to use functions.\n",
      "00:41:31: And you've actually already been using a function.\n",
      "00:41:34: We used the print function. Right here you see \n",
      "that we've been using print multiple times.\n",
      "00:41:39: This is a function. You call this \n",
      "function, you pass in some text,  \n",
      "00:41:43: and then it prints it out on the screen.\n",
      "00:41:45: So that's just a basic example of a \n",
      "function that we've already been using.\n",
      "00:41:49: Now the cool thing is we \n",
      "can create our own function.\n",
      "00:41:53: So, what is a function?\n",
      "00:41:55: Well, it's basically a block of code  \n",
      "00:41:58: that you can package together \n",
      "with a name and it does something.\n",
      "00:42:01: So, in this case anytime you call print \n",
      "or input, it takes some action depending  \n",
      "00:42:07: on what that function is. The neat thing is it \n",
      "makes your code more modular and also reusable.\n",
      "00:42:13: So here for example, every time we \n",
      "want to print something on the screen,  \n",
      "00:42:16: we simply call this function \n",
      "and then it takes that action.\n",
      "00:42:19: We don't have to enter in all the different code \n",
      "associated with printing your text on the screen.\n",
      "00:42:24: We simply rely on this function.\n",
      "00:42:26: So, it makes your code a lot more reuseable.\n",
      "00:42:29: So let's go through and create our own function.\n",
      "00:42:32: Right now, I'll go through and delete all of this \n",
      "code that we had and let's say just to show the  \n",
      "00:42:37: value of functions, let me just enter in print \n",
      "and then Kevin Stratvert has a great channel.\n",
      "00:42:42: I'm going to enter this in three times.\n",
      "00:42:44: I figure the more I say it \n",
      "maybe the more it sticks,  \n",
      "00:42:47: then the more you read it, \n",
      "you might start to believe it.\n",
      "00:42:50: So here I've typed it in three different \n",
      "times and now I'm going to run it.  \n",
      "00:42:55: Here I'll expand the terminal just so we \n",
      "could see it and here printed out three times.\n",
      "00:43:00: Oh, but actually, look at that.\n",
      "00:43:02: It looks like I spelled Stratvert \n",
      "wrong. Stratvert has a T in the middle,  \n",
      "00:43:06: and here I just say Stravord. Now because \n",
      "I'm not using a function for this, well,  \n",
      "00:43:11: I'm using the print function, but I haven't \n",
      "created a function to print this out three times,  \n",
      "00:43:15: so I'd have to go through, and I'd have to \n",
      "correct every single Stravert throughout my code  \n",
      "00:43:20: to correct this and imagine that \n",
      "you referenced something many,  \n",
      "00:43:24: many, many times in your code, and maybe you \n",
      "make an error, you need to update something.\n",
      "00:43:28: It could be a pain to have to go \n",
      "through all of your code to update it.\n",
      "00:43:32: So instead, you can create a function, and \n",
      "I'll show you how we can create a function  \n",
      "00:43:36: to print this out multiple times, and \n",
      "then we can call it whenever we want.\n",
      "00:43:41: OK, so let's create a function.\n",
      "00:43:42: I'll simply go down a few lines.\n",
      "00:43:45: To create a function, we have to type in def.\n",
      "00:43:47: This basically stands for define, so I'll \n",
      "type in def and here we can type in a name  \n",
      "00:43:54: for our function, and I'm going to call \n",
      "this function, let's say print Kevin.\n",
      "00:44:00: So, I've typed in my function name and then all \n",
      "functions need to have parentheses at the end, so  \n",
      "00:44:04: I'll open the parentheses, close the parentheses, \n",
      "and write down here, once again, just like we did  \n",
      "00:44:09: with the if statement, I'll insert a colon. So, \n",
      "I now have my function. When I hit the enter key,  \n",
      "00:44:15: here too, just like with the if statement, \n",
      "you see that it indents it automatically.\n",
      "00:44:19: So once again, it indents and any of the code \n",
      "underneath here will be part of this function.\n",
      "00:44:25: Next, I want to enter in some code in \n",
      "this function, so maybe I'll set up  \n",
      "00:44:28: a variable and I'll call this text and \n",
      "let me insert some text here in quotes,  \n",
      "00:44:33: and maybe I'll say Kevin Stratvert has a \n",
      "great channel, so that's going to be my text.\n",
      "00:44:39: And here maybe I'll just make the \n",
      "error again where I don't have the T.\n",
      "00:44:43: Now right beneath that, here I could use \n",
      "print and maybe I say let's print the text  \n",
      "00:44:47: and I want to print this three times.\n",
      "00:44:50: So, I'll insert it in three times right here.\n",
      "00:44:52: I'm going to delete this earlier example \n",
      "here so we just have the function.\n",
      "00:44:57: So, I have my function now, can I run it?\n",
      "00:44:59: Let's try clicking on run. So I \n",
      "click on run, and I get nothing back.\n",
      "00:45:04: And the reason why is right up \n",
      "here, we've defined a function,  \n",
      "00:45:08: but we haven't actually called this function.\n",
      "00:45:11: So, I've defined what should happen when \n",
      "I call this, but we haven't called it yet,  \n",
      "00:45:15: so here I'll go down and I'll backspace, \n",
      "so I'm out of this block of code that's  \n",
      "00:45:20: associated with this function, and \n",
      "here now I can call my function.\n",
      "00:45:23: So just like we called the print \n",
      "function, here I could say print  \n",
      "00:45:27: and let's type in underscore Kevin and \n",
      "then I'll open and close my parentheses.\n",
      "00:45:31: So right now, this will call the function. \n",
      "So, when Python sees print Kevin,  \n",
      "00:45:37: it'll look up to this definition for \n",
      "Kevin and then it'll execute this code.\n",
      "00:45:41: So, let's click on run to see what happens.\n",
      "00:45:44: Now look at that. Kevin Stravert has a great \n",
      "channel and it printed it out three times.\n",
      "00:45:48: Oh, and look, there's that error in here.\n",
      "00:45:51: So right up here, I could go to my function.\n",
      "00:45:53: I could add the T and then \n",
      "I can hit run and it looks  \n",
      "00:45:56: like that's now successfully updated in all cases.\n",
      "00:45:59: Now I could go through, and I could \n",
      "call this function multiple times.\n",
      "00:46:02: This will really boost my ego.\n",
      "00:46:05: So now when I hit run, look how many times \n",
      "it's printed out, Kevin has a great channel,  \n",
      "00:46:09: every single time I reference this \n",
      "function, it'll go back up here,  \n",
      "00:46:12: it'll look at the function definition, and \n",
      "then it'll run this code within that function.  \n",
      "00:46:17: Wth a function, to be able to call the function, \n",
      "I first need to define it before I can call it.\n",
      "00:46:23: Here I'll remove these two \n",
      "references to the function  \n",
      "00:46:26: and so let's take the call of the \n",
      "function and I'll move it to the very top.\n",
      "00:46:30: So here I call the function and then I define it.\n",
      "00:46:32: So, if I hit run now here you get an error \n",
      "because here it says we'll print Kevin.\n",
      "00:46:36: Well, it doesn't know about that function \n",
      "yet because it comes up later on in the code.\n",
      "00:46:41: So once again, I need to make sure I call \n",
      "this function after I've defined my function.\n",
      "00:46:45: So typically in code, you'll see all \n",
      "the different definitions or all of the  \n",
      "00:46:49: different definitions of the functions at the top.\n",
      "00:46:52: One of the neat things too about \n",
      "using Visual Studio Code is here  \n",
      "00:46:56: when I click over in the function and I \n",
      "hover over, I can collapse this function.\n",
      "00:47:00: So let's say I'm writing code and I want to have a \n",
      "whole bunch of functions that do different things.\n",
      "00:47:05: I can collapse it and then that way it \n",
      "clears up my view a little bit and here  \n",
      "00:47:09: I could expand it if I need to jump into this \n",
      "function and update any of the code within.  \n",
      "00:47:14: With this one function that I defined on \n",
      "top, currently I don't pass anything into  \n",
      "00:47:19: the function and I also don't get \n",
      "anything back from the function.\n",
      "00:47:23: If you remember the print \n",
      "example, here with print,  \n",
      "00:47:26: I'm passing in certain text that I want to print.\n",
      "00:47:28: So basically, I'm sending in \n",
      "an argument or a parameter,  \n",
      "00:47:31: and I can do the same when I create a function.\n",
      "00:47:34: So, let's say instead of entering the text here \n",
      "within the function, let me actually get rid of  \n",
      "00:47:39: this line right here, and right up here as part \n",
      "of my function definition, I'll type in text.\n",
      "00:47:45: So, as I define my function, it's \n",
      "expecting me to pass in some value.\n",
      "00:47:50: So, let's now go down here and look at the \n",
      "position where I'm calling my function.\n",
      "00:47:55: It says print Kevin and here I can now pass \n",
      "in a value or basically pass in a parameter.\n",
      "00:48:01: So, I'll type in Kevin \n",
      "Stratvert has a great channel.\n",
      "00:48:06: So here you'll see as I call this function, \n",
      "it's passing in this parameter or this argument.\n",
      "00:48:12: When I pass this in, here in the definition, it \n",
      "says it's expecting some text to be passed in  \n",
      "00:48:18: and down below the print is taking that \n",
      "text that I pass into this function.\n",
      "00:48:23: So now when I hit run, here \n",
      "you'll see the same result.\n",
      "00:48:25: Kevin Stratvert has a great channel  \n",
      "00:48:27: and this is just an example of how you \n",
      "can pass values into your function.\n",
      "00:48:31: Next, I want to show you how we can \n",
      "put an if statement within a function.\n",
      "00:48:36: So here again I'll type in def.\n",
      "00:48:38: This will define my function and I'm \n",
      "going to call this school age calculator.\n",
      "00:48:43: So, I want to basically \n",
      "determine based on a child's age,  \n",
      "00:48:46: where should they be in school, and \n",
      "I want to get two different values.\n",
      "00:48:50: I want to get the child's age, \n",
      "so I'll type in age as one of the  \n",
      "00:48:54: parameters or arguments I want to get, \n",
      "and I also want the name of the child.\n",
      "00:48:58: Now, just like we did before, let's put in \n",
      "a colon here and then let's press enter.\n",
      "00:49:02: Here once again, you'll see that \n",
      "it automatically indents me and  \n",
      "00:49:05: so that shows that whatever code I \n",
      "write here is part of this function.\n",
      "00:49:10: Now I want to insert my if statement, so I'm going \n",
      "to check first off if the age is less than five.\n",
      "00:49:17: Once again, I'll insert the colon, and when I \n",
      "press enter, here it indents me even more so.\n",
      "00:49:21: Now I'm within this if statement,  \n",
      "00:49:23: so if this evaluates to true, \n",
      "we're going to execute this code.\n",
      "00:49:27: If it's true, I want to display some text, \n",
      "so here I'll call the print function.  \n",
      "00:49:31: Here I'll open it up and maybe \n",
      "I show some text that says  \n",
      "00:49:35: enjoy the time. You're still a young \n",
      "guy, you don't need to be in school yet.\n",
      "00:49:39: So I've typed in some text. Now earlier \n",
      "we've just been printing out text,  \n",
      "00:49:43: but I can also print out \n",
      "variables together with text.\n",
      "00:49:46: So here I could enter a comma \n",
      "and then I'll type in the name.\n",
      "00:49:50: Here I'll type in another comma and let \n",
      "me enter in quotes again, and I'll say  \n",
      "00:49:54: is only, here I'll enter another comma, \n",
      "and then I'll type in the variable age.\n",
      "00:49:58: So here you can see what it'll do, let's \n",
      "say the age is 3 and the name is Thomas.\n",
      "00:50:03: It'll say enjoy the time, Thomas is only three, \n",
      "so that's what will display if he's under 5.\n",
      "00:50:09: Let me hit enter and here now I \n",
      "want to enter another condition,  \n",
      "00:50:12: so I'll hit back space so I go back, and \n",
      "here I'll enter elif, basically else if  \n",
      "00:50:18: and I want to say if age let's \n",
      "say, is equivalent to five,  \n",
      "00:50:23: then I'll enter the colon and here maybe I'll say \n",
      "enjoy kindergarten, and then I'll show the name.\n",
      "00:50:28: So here I'll type in print and \n",
      "then I'll open the parentheses  \n",
      "00:50:32: and I'll type in the quotes and \n",
      "here we'll say enjoy kindergarten,  \n",
      "00:50:36: and here I'll type in a comma and let me type in \n",
      "another comma here and then I'll display the name.\n",
      "00:50:41: So here it'll say enjoy kindergarten, Thomas.\n",
      "00:50:44: And lastly, I want to add one more condition, \n",
      "so I'll hit enter, backspace, and here I can  \n",
      "00:50:49: say else, colon, and here, maybe I'll say print \n",
      "and this one, I'll just display text and I'll  \n",
      "00:50:55: say they grow up so fast exclamation mark. \n",
      "I've now finished defining my function and I  \n",
      "00:51:02: have all of the different conditions within \n",
      "the function, so here I could enter down,  \n",
      "00:51:06: and I'll press backspace twice, so I exit out \n",
      "of both the conditions and also the function.\n",
      "00:51:12: So now here I can call my function. So,  \n",
      "00:51:14: I'll call school age calculator and here \n",
      "I need to pass in two different values.\n",
      "00:51:20: I'll pass in the age, I'll enter a comma, \n",
      "and then I'll type in the name, Thomas.\n",
      "00:51:25: So now if I run this, here you'll see that it \n",
      "calls the function and then it goes through  \n",
      "00:51:29: all of these different conditions, and so here, \n",
      "while Thomas is less than five, he's only three,  \n",
      "00:51:34: so it says enjoy the time, Thomas is \n",
      "only three, and here we can test it out,  \n",
      "00:51:38: here I'll change it to five, and if I run \n",
      "it here, it says enjoy kindergarten, Thomas,  \n",
      "00:51:43: and let's say Thomas is now 10, and I'll run \n",
      "it, and here it says they grow up so fast.\n",
      "00:51:48: So here now you see how we can call a function \n",
      "and here we pass in values into that function,  \n",
      "00:51:54: and it uses those values to run an if \n",
      "statement and to evaluate which one is true.\n",
      "00:52:00: Next I want to show you how you can also \n",
      "get a parameter back from your function.\n",
      "00:52:05: So so far, we've looked at how you could just run \n",
      "a function on its own, how you could pass values  \n",
      "00:52:10: into the function, and now we're going to look at \n",
      "how you can get a value back from the function.\n",
      "00:52:15: I'm going to go through, let's remove this code \n",
      "right here, and let's start again from scratch.\n",
      "00:52:20: For this one, it's just going \n",
      "to be a really simple example.\n",
      "00:52:23: I want to know what is your age going to be in \n",
      "10 years and we'll use a function to do this.\n",
      "00:52:29: So here once again, let's define \n",
      "a function by typing in def  \n",
      "00:52:33: and here the function name will be add ten to age.\n",
      "00:52:36: Once I've typed in the function name,  \n",
      "00:52:38: here I want to get one bit of input \n",
      "into my function or one parameter.\n",
      "00:52:42: Here I'll type in the age, so \n",
      "someone will send in their age,  \n",
      "00:52:45: and then the function will add 10 to that age.\n",
      "00:52:48: At the end of the definition of the \n",
      "function, let's enter a colon and hit enter.\n",
      "00:52:52: Here this automatically indents me and now right \n",
      "now I want to figure out what the new age is.\n",
      "00:52:58: So here I'll create a variable called New Age  \n",
      "00:53:01: and I want to set that equal to \n",
      "the age that's being passed in.\n",
      "00:53:05: So, I'll type in age and I'm going to add \n",
      "10 to it, and right underneath that now  \n",
      "00:53:10: once the function runs through and it does \n",
      "its magic, I want to return that value,  \n",
      "00:53:15: so here I'll type in return, and I want to \n",
      "return the new age, so I'll select this.\n",
      "00:53:20: This will send the value back or return the \n",
      "value once the function is done running.  \n",
      "00:53:26: Here now, I want to call my function, \n",
      "and when I call the function,  \n",
      "00:53:29: I can assign that return value to a variable.\n",
      "00:53:32: So here maybe I create a new \n",
      "variable called How old will  \n",
      "00:53:36: I be and I can set that equal to my function.\n",
      "00:53:41: So here I'll call the function add ten to age  \n",
      "00:53:44: and here I want to pass in let's say my \n",
      "son who’s three, so I'll pass in three.\n",
      "00:53:50: So once again, if I run this right \n",
      "now, it won't actually do anything.\n",
      "00:53:53: It's assigning the output, which is 13 to how \n",
      "old will I be, but now I need to print it out.\n",
      "00:53:59: So right down here let me type in print and \n",
      "I'm going to print in how old will I be.\n",
      "00:54:05: And now if I hit run, here we'll \n",
      "see that that comes back as 13.\n",
      "00:54:10: Now once again, just to see how this \n",
      "works, here I'm saying how old will I be?\n",
      "00:54:14: This is a variable and I'm assigning this value \n",
      "to it, which is basically my function of add  \n",
      "00:54:19: ten to age, and I'm passing in three, so here \n",
      "it gets the age of three, it takes 3, adds 10,  \n",
      "00:54:26: it assigns its new age and once it's done running \n",
      "through the function, it returns the new age.\n",
      "00:54:31: So, the new age is 13 and it assigns 13 to how \n",
      "old will I be and then here it prints out 13.\n",
      "00:54:37: So that's how it works, and that's how you can \n",
      "get or you could return a value from a function.\n",
      "00:54:43: Next, we're going to look \n",
      "at how you can use loops.\n",
      "00:54:46: What is a loop?\n",
      "00:54:48: Basically, it allows you to execute a block of \n",
      "code multiple times, so think of it this way.\n",
      "00:54:55: Every single week my wife \n",
      "comes to me and says, Kevin,  \n",
      "00:54:58: can you take out the trash, and \n",
      "she asks me that every single week.\n",
      "00:55:03: So, in a sense, that's kind of like a loop.\n",
      "00:55:06: All right, let's jump on the PC and let's \n",
      "see how we can create a loop in Python.\n",
      "00:55:11: So, let's now create a loop and there \n",
      "are two different types of loops.\n",
      "00:55:15: One of them is called a while loop and \n",
      "the other one is called a for loop.\n",
      "00:55:20: We're going to start with a while loop, \n",
      "and it's actually pretty easy to do.\n",
      "00:55:25: I'm going to create a variable, just call \n",
      "it X and I'll assign it the value of 0.\n",
      "00:55:31: And so here now I can type in a while loop.\n",
      "00:55:33: So, I'll say, let's say while and \n",
      "let's say X is less than five.\n",
      "00:55:38: So, while this value is less than five, I want it \n",
      "to execute some code, so here I'll insert a colon.\n",
      "00:55:45: We do this with our if \n",
      "statements, with our functions.\n",
      "00:55:47: Here when I hit enter now, it automatically \n",
      "indents me, so I'm now within the loop.\n",
      "00:55:52: And here I could just say let's say print X, so \n",
      "I'll enter that in and then right after I print X,  \n",
      "00:55:58: I want to make sure I increment X, \n",
      "otherwise it will be an infinite loop.\n",
      "00:56:01: So here I'll type in X = X + 1, \n",
      "just a really simple example.\n",
      "00:56:06: We start out at zero and here it \n",
      "will say if X is less than five,  \n",
      "00:56:10: in which case it starts at zero. It is, so \n",
      "then it prints X, and then we add one. So  \n",
      "00:56:14: now X is 1 and X is still less than five, \n",
      "so it'll keep executing until it reaches 4.\n",
      "00:56:20: So, let's run this to see how it works. So \n",
      "here it prints out 01234 and then once X = 5,  \n",
      "00:56:27: well, it's no longer less than five, so \n",
      "then we exit our loop and it's all done.\n",
      "00:56:32: Note, that's the basics of how you \n",
      "can create just a very simple loop.\n",
      "00:56:36: There's also another loop called a for loop, so \n",
      "I'll go down right here and let's type in for.\n",
      "00:56:42: And this is also pretty simple. Here I can type \n",
      "in for and let's say 4 X in range, let's say five  \n",
      "00:56:50: through 10, and then here \n",
      "I'll close the parentheses,  \n",
      "00:56:53: enter a colon, and here too, \n",
      "I'll print the value of X.\n",
      "00:56:56: Let me delete the code up above, and here \n",
      "what it'll do is it'll go through that range,  \n",
      "00:57:02: so when I hit run here, you see that it starts \n",
      "at 5 and it goes all the way up until 10,  \n",
      "00:57:07: but it doesn't include 10, so this is \n",
      "another form of a loop that you can use.\n",
      "00:57:12: You can do some pretty neat things with loops. \n",
      "Here for example, I have the variable days and  \n",
      "00:57:18: I have an array assigned to it and \n",
      "these are just all the days of the week.  \n",
      "00:57:23: Here I can use a for loop to write out all the \n",
      "days of the week, so here I could say for d,  \n",
      "00:57:29: here I'm creating a variable, and I'll say in \n",
      "days, so here I'm looking at this variable.\n",
      "00:57:34: Here I'll insert a colon and maybe I just want to \n",
      "print out the value of d. So, as it goes through  \n",
      "00:57:40: each day of the week, and here I can enter run \n",
      "and here it'll go through the variable of days,  \n",
      "00:57:45: and here it prints out every single \n",
      "day of the week, so that's pretty cool.\n",
      "00:57:49: Now, one of the neat things too is you can start \n",
      "using some of the logic that we learned up above  \n",
      "00:57:54: in your loops, so let's say that I want \n",
      "to know what are all of the days before  \n",
      "00:57:59: Thursday, and once we hit \n",
      "Thursday, I want you to stop.  \n",
      "00:58:03: Here I can insert an if statement, so I'll say \n",
      "if and let's say if d is equivalent to let's say  \n",
      "00:58:10: Thursday, so I'll type in Thursday, and at this \n",
      "point I want it to stop. So I'll type in break.\n",
      "00:58:17: So here if we click on run, here you'll \n",
      "see it goes through Monday, Tuesday,  \n",
      "00:58:21: Wednesday and then it looks like it hits \n",
      "Thursday, and at that point we stop the loop.\n",
      "00:58:26: So, at that point we break,  \n",
      "00:58:28: and we no longer print any of the other days. \n",
      "With loops, we can also skip over items.\n",
      "00:58:34: So, let's say that once we get to Thursday, I \n",
      "don't want it to include Thursday in the list,  \n",
      "00:58:39: but I still want it to continue \n",
      "and look at Friday, Saturday,  \n",
      "00:58:42: and Sunday. Instead of using break, \n",
      "I can use something called continue.\n",
      "00:58:47: So now when I run the code, here \n",
      "you'll see Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,  \n",
      "00:58:50: and then it found Thursday, and we \n",
      "simply want to skip over that item.\n",
      "00:58:53: So, we added continue.\n",
      "00:58:54: So here you see it skips over and then \n",
      "we get Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n",
      "00:58:58: So once again you can use logic in your loops.\n",
      "00:59:01: You could also have it break and \n",
      "continue. So far throughout this video,  \n",
      "00:59:05: we've been looking at some of the fundamentals, \n",
      "and we've been writing all of our own code;  \n",
      "00:59:10: however, one thing you can do is you can \n",
      "build on top of what others have already done  \n",
      "00:59:15: using libraries and also modules, and there are \n",
      "lots of fantastic libraries that you can use.\n",
      "00:59:21: Let's say for instance that we \n",
      "want to print out the value of Pi.\n",
      "00:59:25: It turns out there's an \n",
      "existing library called math.\n",
      "00:59:28: We could simply type in import and type in math,  \n",
      "00:59:32: and right beneath that, let's use our standard \n",
      "print function, and here I'll type in print.\n",
      "00:59:37: And why don't we say something like pi is,  \n",
      "00:59:40: and then I'll insert a comma and here now I can \n",
      "refer to the math library and I'll type in .pi.\n",
      "00:59:47: So, I want to get the pi value back  \n",
      "00:59:49: and here as I'm typing that out, you'll see \n",
      "all sorts of suggestions of what I could use.\n",
      "00:59:54: So here when I click on run now, \n",
      "here it'll print out the value of pi.\n",
      "00:59:58: So once again, when you're programming, you don't \n",
      "necessarily have to write everything on your own.\n",
      "01:00:02: Instead, you can build on top of what others \n",
      "have done. If you were following along today,  \n",
      "01:00:08: you might have occasionally run into different \n",
      "errors as you were trying to execute your code  \n",
      "01:00:13: and they can really be a pain to resolve.\n",
      "01:00:15: I want to go through three of the key errors that \n",
      "you might run into and how you can resolve them.\n",
      "01:00:22: So, let's take one example.\n",
      "01:00:23: Here I'm going to type in print, \n",
      "and I'll type in Hello World.\n",
      "01:00:27: Now if you've been following along, you probably \n",
      "know that every time I type in this function,  \n",
      "01:00:31: and I type in text, I need to include my \n",
      "quotes around this, but I haven't done that.\n",
      "01:00:36: When I hit run right now, here I get an error,  \n",
      "01:00:39: and this is referred to as a syntax error \n",
      "and the reason why is, I didn't follow  \n",
      "01:00:44: the rules of the print function, or I \n",
      "didn't follow the syntax rules for Python.\n",
      "01:00:48: The best way to troubleshoot these \n",
      "is to simply look through your code  \n",
      "01:00:52: to find out where the error might be.\n",
      "01:00:54: So here I get name error \n",
      "hello world is not defined.\n",
      "01:00:57: So here it thinks hello world is a variable.\n",
      "01:01:00: So, this is one way where you can look at the \n",
      "error message down here and that'll help you  \n",
      "01:01:03: troubleshoot up above what the problem is. Now you \n",
      "might run into another type of error, let's say I  \n",
      "01:01:09: take 10 / 0 and then I try to run this, and we all \n",
      "know that you can't divide by zero. Right here I  \n",
      "01:01:16: get a zero-division error division by zero. This \n",
      "is referred to as a runtime error. It just fails.\n",
      "01:01:23: Now you could look down here at the error \n",
      "message to see what it was and that might  \n",
      "01:01:27: help you troubleshoot where the problem is in your \n",
      "code, and typically when you get an error message,  \n",
      "01:01:32: you could go to something like stackoverflow.com \n",
      "and you can look up your error message to see  \n",
      "01:01:37: if other people have encountered similar errors \n",
      "and that'll help you get down to the root cause.  \n",
      "01:01:42: And lastly, there's another type \n",
      "of error that you might encounter.\n",
      "01:01:46: Let's say I type in name equals. Let's say Kevin,  \n",
      "01:01:49: just like we did earlier and here now, let's \n",
      "say I want to print, and I'll say hello name.\n",
      "01:01:54: So, let's say I want to print the \n",
      "name that I assigned to this variable.\n",
      "01:01:58: Here let me insert the \n",
      "parentheses and then I'll hit run.\n",
      "01:02:02: So down here, it just says hello name, and it's \n",

age\\xa0\\xa0\", '005344': \"and here I want to pass in let's say my\\xa0\\nson who’s three, so I'll pass in three.\", '005350': \"So once again, if I run this right\\xa0\\nnow, it won't actually do anything.\", '005353': \"It's assigning the output, which is 13 to how\\xa0\\nold will I be, but now I need to print it out.\", '005359': \"So right down here let me type in print and\\xa0\\nI'm going to print in how old will I be.\", '005405': \"And now if I hit run, here we'll\\xa0\\nsee that that comes back as 13.\", '005410': \"Now once again, just to see how this\\xa0\\nworks, here I'm saying

'So, the new age is 13 and it assigns 13 to how\\xa0\\nold will I be and then here it prints out 13.', '005437': \"So that's how it works, and that's how you can\\xa0\\nget or you could return a value

single week.', '005503': \"So, in a sense, that's kind of like a loop.\", '005506': \"All right, let's jump on the PC and let's\\xa0\\nsee how we can create a loop in Python.\", '005511': \"So, let's now create a loop and there\\xa0\\nare two different types of loops.\", '005515': 'One of them is called a while loop and\\xa0\\nthe other one is called a for loop.', '005520': \"We're going to start with a while loop,\\xa0\\nand it's actually pretty easy to do.\", '005525': \"I'm going to create a variable, just call\\xa0\\nit X and I'll assign it the value of 0.\", '005531': 'And so here now I can type in a while loop.', '005533': \"So, I'll say, let's say while and\\xa0\\nlet's say X is less than five.\", '005538': \"So, while this value is less than five, I want it\\xa0\\nto execute some code, so here I'll insert a colon.\", '005545': 'We do this with our if\\xa0\\nstatements, with our functions.', '005547': \"Here when I hit enter now, it automatically\\xa0\\nindents me, so I'm now within the loop.\", '005552': \"And here I could just say let's say print X, so\\xa0\\nI'll enter that in and then right after I print X,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005558': 'I want to make sure I increment X,\\xa0\\notherwise it will be an infinite loop.', '005601': \"So here I'll type in X = X + 1,\\xa0\\njust a really simple example.\", '005606': 'We start out at zero and here it\\xa0\\nwill say if X is less than five,\\xa0\\xa0', '005610': 'in which case it starts at zero. It is, so\\xa0\\nthen it prints X, and then we add one. So\\xa0\\xa0', '005614': \"now X is 1 and X is still less than five,\\xa0\\nso it'll keep executing until it reaches 4.\", '005620': \"So, let's run this to see how it works. So\\xa0\\nhere it prints out 01234 and then once X = 5,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005627': \"well, it's no longer less than five, so\\xa0\\nthen we exit our loop and it's all done.\", '005632': \"Note, that's the basics of how you\\xa0\\ncan create just a very simple loop.\", '005636': \"There's also another loop called a for loop, so\\xa0\\nI'll go down right here and let's type in for.\", '005642': \"And this is also pretty simple. Here I can type\\xa0\\nin for and let's say 4 X in range, let's say five\\xa0\\xa0\", '005650': \"through 10, and then here\\xa0\\nI'll close the parentheses,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005653': \"enter a colon, and here too,\\xa0\\nI'll print the value of X.\", '005656': \"Let me delete the code up above, and here\\xa0\\nwhat it'll do is it'll go through that range,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005702': 'so when I hit run here, you see that it starts\\xa0\\nat 5 and it goes all the way up until 10,\\xa0\\xa0', '005707': \"but it doesn't include 10, so this is\\xa0\\nanother form of a loop that you can use.\", '005712': 'You can do some pretty neat things with loops.\\xa0\\nHere for example, I have the variable days and\\xa0\\xa0', '005718': 'I have an array assigned to it and\\xa0\\nthese are just all the days of the week.\\xa0\\xa0', '005723': 'Here I can use a for loop to write out all the\\xa0\\ndays of the week, so here I could say for d,\\xa0\\xa0', '005729': \"here I'm creating a variable, and I'll say in\\xa0\\ndays, so here I'm looking at this variable.\", '005734': \"Here I'll insert a colon and maybe I just want to\\xa0\\nprint out the value of d. So, as it goes through\\xa0\\xa0\", '005740': \"each day of the week, and here I can enter run\\xa0\\nand here it'll go through the variable of days,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005745': \"and here it prints out every single\\xa0\\nday of the week, so that's pretty cool.\", '005749': 'Now, one of the neat things too is you can start\\xa0\\nusing some of the logic that we learned up above\\xa0\\xa0', '005754': \"in your loops, so let's say that I want\\xa0\\nto know what are all of the days before\\xa0\\xa0\", '005759': 'Thursday, and once we hit\\xa0\\nThursday, I want you to stop.\\xa0\\xa0', '005803': \"Here I can insert an if statement, so I'll say\\xa0\\nif and let's say if d is equivalent to let's say\\xa0\\xa0\", '005810': \"Thursday, so I'll type in Thursday, and at this\\xa0\\npoint I want it to stop. So I'll type in break.\", '005817': \"So here if we click on run, here you'll\\xa0\\nsee it goes through Monday, Tuesday,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005821': 'Wednesday and then it looks like it hits\\xa0\\nThursday, and at that point we stop the loop.', '005826': 'So, at that point we break,\\xa0\\xa0', '005828': 'and we no longer print any of the other days.\\xa0\\nWith loops, we can also skip over items.', '005834': \"So, let's say that once we get to Thursday, I\\xa0\\ndon't want it to include Thursday in the list,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005839': 'but I still want it to continue\\xa0\\nand look at Friday, Saturday,\\xa0\\xa0', '005842': 'and Sunday. Instead of using break,\\xa0\\nI can use something called continue.', '005847': \"So now when I run the code, here\\xa0\\nyou'll see Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005850': 'and then it found Thursday, and we\\xa0\\nsimply want to skip over that item.', '005853': 'So, we added continue.', '005854': 'So here you see it skips over and then\\xa0\\nwe get Friday, Saturday and Sunday.', '005858': 'So once again you can use logic in your loops.', '005901': 'You could also have it break and\\xa0\\ncontinue. So far throughout this video,\\xa0\\xa0', '005905': \"we've been looking at some of the fundamentals,\\xa0\\nand we've been writing all of our own code;\\xa0\\xa0\", '005910': 'however, one thing you can do is you can\\xa0\\nbuild on top of what others have already done\\xa0\\xa0', '005915': 'using libraries and also modules, and there are\\xa0\\nlots of fantastic libraries that you can use.', '005921': \"Let's say for instance that we\\xa0\\nwant to print out the value of Pi.\", '005925': \"It turns out there's an\\xa0\\nexisting library called math.\", '005928': 'We could simply type in import and type in math,\\xa0\\xa0', '005932': \"and right beneath that, let's use our standard\\xa0\\nprint function, and here I'll type in print.\", '005937': \"And why don't we say something like pi is,\\xa0\\xa0\", '005940': \"and then I'll insert a comma and here now I can\\xa0\\nrefer to the math library and I'll type in .pi.\", '005947': 'So, I want to get the pi value back\\xa0\\xa0', '005949': \"and here as I'm typing that out, you'll see\\xa0\\nall sorts of suggestions of what I could use.\", '005954': \"So here when I click on run now,\\xa0\\nhere it'll print out the value of pi.\", '005958': \"So once again, when you're programming, you don't\\xa0\\nnecessarily have to write everything on your own.\", '010002': 'Instead, you can build on top of what others\\xa0\\nhave done.
